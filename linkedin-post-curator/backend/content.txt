00:00:00.233 The following is aconversation with Jeff Bezos,
00:00:03.286 founder of Amazon and Blue Origin.
00:00:06.322 This is his first timedoing a conversation
00:00:09.256 of this kind and of this length.
00:00:11.380 And as he told me, it felt likewe could have easily talked
00:00:14.214 for many more hours, and I\'m sure we will.
00:00:17.801 This is the Lex Fridman podcast.
00:00:19.856 And now, dear friends, here\'s Jeff Bezos.
00:00:24.599 You spent a lot of yourchildhood with your grandfather
00:00:27.734 on a ranch here in Texas,
00:00:30.294 and I heard you had a lot ofwork to do around the ranch.
00:00:33.057 So what\'s the coolest jobyou remember doing there?
00:00:35.437 Wow, coolest.
00:00:36.659 Most interesting.
00:00:38.087 Most memorable.
00:00:39.091 Most memorable.
00:00:40.089 Most impactful.
00:00:41.308 And it was a real working ranch.
00:00:42.999 My grand, I spent allmy summers on that ranch
00:00:46.753 from age four to 16.
00:00:49.276 And my grandfather wasreally taking me to those
00:00:52.933 in the summers, in the early summers,
00:00:54.378 he was letting me pretendto help on the ranch.
00:00:57.658 \'Cause of course, a4-year-old is a burden,
00:00:59.376 not a help in real life.
00:01:01.233 He was really just watchingme and taking care of me
00:01:04.944 and be was doing thatbecause my mom was so young.
00:01:07.996 She had me when she was 17,
00:01:09.953 and so he was sort of giving her a break.
00:01:12.037 And my grandmother and my grandfather
00:01:13.433 would take me for these summers.
00:01:15.056 But as I got a little older,
00:01:16.251 I actually was helpful onthe ranch and I loved it.
00:01:18.718 I was out there,
00:01:20.193 like my grandfather hada huge influence on me,
00:01:23.604 huge factor in my life.
00:01:25.516 I did all the jobs youwould do on a ranch.
00:01:28.895 I\'ve fixed windmills and laid fences
00:01:33.132 and pipelines and youknow, done all the things
00:01:36.557 that any rancher would do,
00:01:38.096 vaccinated, the animals, everything.
00:01:41.596 But we had a you know, my grandfather,
00:01:44.136 after my grandmother died, I was about 12
00:01:47.215 and I kept coming to the ranch.
00:01:48.617 So it was then, it was justhim and me, just the two of us.
00:01:51.254 And he was completelyaddicted to the soap opera,
00:01:55.916 the Days of Our Lives.
00:01:57.673 And we would go back tothe ranch house every day
00:02:00.706 around 1:00 PM or so towatch days of our lives
00:02:03.980 like sands through an hourglass.
00:02:06.433 So are the days of our lives.
00:02:07.974 Just the image of the two sitting there
00:02:11.296 watching a soap opera as ranchers.
00:02:12.953 He had these big, crazy dogs.
00:02:14.434 It was really a veryformative experience for me.
00:02:16.617 But the key thing about it for me,
00:02:18.677 the great gift I got from it
00:02:21.935 was that my grandfather wasso resourceful, you know,
00:02:25.732 he did everything himself.
00:02:26.895 He made his own veterinary tools.
00:02:28.591 He would make needles tosuture the cattle up with,
00:02:32.157 like he would find a littlepiece of wire and heat it up
00:02:34.287 and pound it thin and drilla hole in it and sharpen it.
00:02:37.239 So, you know, you learn different things
00:02:40.295 on a ranch than you would learn
00:02:41.881 you know, growing up in a city.
00:02:43.412 So self-reliance.
00:02:44.567 Yeah, like figuring outthat you can solve problems
00:02:48.271 with enough persistence and ingenuity.
00:02:52.127 And my grandfather bought a D6 bulldozer,
00:02:55.573 which is a big bulldozer, andhe got it for like $5,000.
00:02:58.511 \'cause it was completely broken down.
00:03:00.392 It was like a 1955Caterpillar, D6 bulldozer
00:03:04.589 knew it would\'ve cost, I don\'t know,
00:03:06.394 more than a $100,000.
00:03:08.012 And we spent an entire summer fixing,
00:03:10.887 like repairing that bulldozer.
00:03:13.170 And we\'d, you know, use mail order
00:03:15.549 to buy big gears for the transmission.
00:03:17.633 And they\'d show up.
00:03:18.749 They\'d be too heavy to move,
00:03:19.873 so we\'d have to build a crane, you know,
00:03:21.911 just that kind of, kinda thatproblem solving mentality.
00:03:26.131 He had it so powerfully, you know,
00:03:30.589 he did all of his own.
00:03:31.939 He\'d just, he didn\'t pick upthe phone and call somebody.
00:03:35.448 He would figure it out on his own.
00:03:37.370 Doing his own veterinary work, you know.
00:03:39.389 But just the image of the two of you
00:03:41.009 fixing a D6 bulldozer and then going in
00:03:43.684 for a little break at 1:00PM to watch a soap opera.
00:03:46.578 Laying on the floor.
00:03:48.710 That\'s how he watched TV.
00:03:50.093 Yeah.
00:03:50.926 He was a really, really remarkable guy.
00:03:52.468 That\'s how I imagine Clint Eastwood also
00:03:55.759 in all those westerns.
00:03:57.657 When he\'s not doing what he is doing,
00:03:59.788 he\'s just watching soap operas.
00:04:01.447 All right, I read that you fell in love
00:04:04.325 with the idea of spaceand space exploration
00:04:05.886 when you were five watching Neil Armstrong
00:04:07.616 walking on the moon.
00:04:10.953 So let me ask you to lookback at the historical context
00:04:14.766 and impact of that.
00:04:16.317 So the space race from 1957 to 1969
00:04:21.033 between the Soviet Union andthe US was in many ways epic.
00:04:25.717 It was a rapid sequence of dramatic events
00:04:29.216 for satellite to space,for a human to space,
00:04:32.075 for a spacewalk, firstuncrewed landing on the moon,
00:04:35.538 then some failures, explosions,
00:04:38.373 deaths on both sides actually,
00:04:40.416 and then the first humanwalking on the moon.
00:04:43.801 What are some of themore inspiring moments
00:04:46.134 or insights you take away from that time,
00:04:47.737 those few years, that just 12 years?
00:04:51.120 Well, I mean, there\'sso much inspiring there.
00:04:55.678 You know, one of the greatthings to take away from that,
00:04:57.419 one of the great von Braun quotes is
00:04:59.405 "I have come to use the wordimpossible with great caution."
00:05:04.461 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:05:07.520 And so that\'s kind ofthe big story of Apollo
00:05:10.480 is that things, youknow, going to the moon
00:05:13.775 was literally an analogy that people used
00:05:17.243 for something that\'s impossible.
00:05:19.002 You know, oh yeah, you\'lldo that when you know,
00:05:21.382 men walk on the moon.
00:05:22.464 Yeah.
00:05:23.297 And of course it finally happened.
00:05:26.134 So, you know, I think itwas pulled forward in time
00:05:29.069 because of the space race,
00:05:31.513 I think you know, with thegeopolitical implications
00:05:34.972 and you know, how muchresource was put into it,
00:05:37.730 you know, at the peak,that program was spending,
00:05:39.902 you know, two or 3% ofGDP on the Apollo program.
00:05:43.970 So much resource.
00:05:45.604 I think it was pulled forward in time.
00:05:47.511 You know, we kind of did it ahead
00:05:50.529 of when we quote unquoteshould have done it.
00:05:52.639 Yeah.
00:05:53.472 And so in that way, it\'salso a technical marvel.
00:05:57.022 I mean, it\'s truly incredible.
00:05:58.971 It\'s, you know, it\'sthe 20th century version
00:06:03.109 of building the pyramids or something.
00:06:04.935 It\'s you know, it\'s an achievement
00:06:07.530 that because it was pulled forward in time
00:06:09.335 and because it did something
00:06:10.676 that had previously thought impossible,
00:06:12.615 it rightly deservesits place, as you know,
00:06:14.832 in the pantheon of greathuman achievements.
00:06:17.758 And of course, you namedthe projects The Rockets
00:06:21.293 that Blue Origin is working on
00:06:22.971 after some of the folks involved.
00:06:23.999 Yeah.
00:06:24.832 I don\'t understand whyI didn\'t say New Gagarin.
00:06:26.477 is that-
00:06:27.310 There\'s an American bias in the naming.
00:06:28.654 I apologize.
00:06:29.653 It\'s very strange.
00:06:30.808 Lex.
00:06:31.641 Just asking for a friend.
00:06:33.348 Clarify.
00:06:34.181 I\'m a big fan of Gagarin though.
00:06:36.031 And in fact, I think hisfirst words in space,
00:06:41.010 I think are incredible.
00:06:43.752 He, you know, he purportedlysaid "my God, it\'s blue."
00:06:47.692 And that really drives home.
00:06:49.643 No one had seen the earth from space.
00:06:52.446 No one knew that we wereon this blue planet.
00:06:55.442 Yeah.
00:06:56.275 No one knew what itlooked like from out there.
00:06:58.129 And Gagarin was thefirst person to see it.
00:07:01.027 One of the things I thinkabout is how dangerous
00:07:04.114 those early days were for Gagarin,
00:07:06.989 for Glen, for everybody involved.
00:07:08.729 Like how big of a riskthey were all taking.
00:07:11.229 They were taking huge risks.
00:07:12.429 I\'m not sure what the Soviets thought
00:07:14.826 about Gagarin\'s flight,
00:07:16.653 but I think that the Americans thought
00:07:19.009 that the Alan Shephard flight,
00:07:20.833 the flight that you know,New Shephard is named after,
00:07:22.653 the first American in space.
00:07:24.133 He went on his suborbital flight.
00:07:26.330 They thought he had abouta 75% chance of success.
00:07:31.080 So, you know, that\'s apretty big risk, a 25% risk.
00:07:36.115 It\'s kind of interestingthat Alan Shephard
00:07:38.351 is not quite as famous as John Glenn.
00:07:40.030 So for people who don\'tknow, Alan Shephard
00:07:42.033 is the first astronaut-
00:07:44.707 The first American in space.
00:07:46.491 American in suborbital flight.
00:07:48.610 Correct.
00:07:49.443 And then the first orbital flight is-
00:07:51.030 John Glenn is the firstAmerican to orbit the earth.
00:07:54.833 By the way, I have themost charming, sweet,
00:07:58.048 incredible letter from John Glenn,
00:08:00.987 which I have framed andhang on my office wall.
00:08:03.987 What did he say?
00:08:04.991 Where he tells me how grateful he is
00:08:07.807 that we have named New Glenn after him.
00:08:10.610 And he sent me that letterabout a week before he died.
00:08:13.642 And it\'s really an incredible,
00:08:15.806 it\'s also a very funny letter.
00:08:17.071 He\'s writing and he says you know,
00:08:20.392 this is a letter about NewGlenn from the original Glenn.
00:08:24.113 And he\'s just, he\'s gota great sense of humor,
00:08:26.983 and he\'s very happy about it and grateful.
00:08:29.226 It\'s very sweet.
00:08:30.271 Does he say ps don\'t mess this up?
00:08:31.810 Or is that-
00:08:34.201 No, he doesn\'t.
00:08:35.140 Make me look good.
00:08:36.015 He doesn\'t do that.
00:08:37.158 Okay.
00:08:37.991 But wait, but John, wherever you are,
00:08:38.823 we got you covered.
00:08:39.657 All right, good.
00:08:41.530 So back to maybe the big picture of space.
00:08:44.295 When you look up at thestars and think big,
00:08:47.912 what do you hope isthe future of humanity?
00:08:49.891 Hundreds, thousands ofyears from now out in space?
00:08:54.135 I would love to see, you know,
00:08:56.528 a trillion humans livingin the solar system.
00:09:01.566 If we had a trillion humans,
00:09:03.251 we would have at any giventime a thousand Mozarts
00:09:06.314 and a thousand Einsteins.
00:09:08.473 That would, you know, our solarsystem would be full of life
00:09:11.736 and intelligence and energy.
00:09:14.116 And we can easily supporta civilization that large
00:09:17.773 with all of the resourcesin the solar system.
00:09:21.314 So what do you think that looks like?
00:09:23.289 Giant space stations?
00:09:24.633 Yeah, the only way to get to that vision
00:09:26.695 is with giant space stations.
00:09:28.796 You know, the planetarysurfaces are just way too small.
00:09:31.397 So you can, I mean, unless you turn them
00:09:34.130 into giant space stations or something.
00:09:36.608 But, but yeah, we will takematerials from the moon
00:09:40.853 and from near earth objectsand from the asteroid belt
00:09:44.679 and so on, and we\'ll buildgiant O\'Neill style colonies
00:09:49.091 and people will live in those.
00:09:50.919 And they have a lot of advantagesover planetary surfaces.
00:09:54.013 You can spin them to getnormal earth gravity.
00:09:57.734 You can put them where you want them.
00:09:59.398 I think most people aregonna wanna live near Earth,
00:10:03.112 not necessarily in earthorbit, but in you know, earth,
00:10:07.808 but near earth vicinity orbits.
00:10:10.700 And so they can move youknow, relatively quickly
00:10:15.251 back and forth betweentheir station and Earth.
00:10:19.137 So I think a lot of people,
00:10:20.455 especially in the early stages,
00:10:21.813 are not gonna want togive up Earth altogether.
00:10:24.894 They go to earth for vacation.
00:10:26.695 Yeah.
00:10:27.528 Same way that you know, you might go
00:10:29.157 to Yellowstone National Park for vacation.
00:10:31.389 People will, and no one,
00:10:33.210 and people will get to choosewhere they live on earth
00:10:35.693 or whether they live in space,
00:10:37.853 but they\'ll be able touse much more energy
00:10:40.575 and much more material resource in space
00:10:42.920 than they would be able to use on earth.
00:10:45.514 One of the interesting ideas you had
00:10:47.048 is to move the heavyindustry away from Earth.
00:10:49.810 So people sometimes have this idea
00:10:52.034 that somehow spaceexploration is in conflict
00:10:55.912 with the celebration of the planet earth,
00:10:58.593 that we should focus on preserving earth.
00:11:00.559 And basically your ideas that space travel
00:11:04.321 and space exploration isa way to preserve earth.
00:11:06.773 Exactly.
00:11:07.872 This planet, we\'ve sent roboticprobes to all the planets.
00:11:13.159 We know that this is the good one.
00:11:16.380 Yeah.
00:11:17.595 Not to play favorites or anything.
00:11:19.088 But earth really is the good planet.
00:11:20.850 It\'s amazing, the ecosystem we have here,
00:11:24.258 all of the life and thelush, the plant life
00:11:28.810 and you know, the waterresources, everything.
00:11:30.764 This planet is really extraordinary.
00:11:33.273 And of course, we evolved on this planet,
00:11:35.159 so of course it\'s perfect for us,
00:11:37.394 but it\'s also perfect forall the advanced life forms
00:11:39.670 on this planet, all the animals and so on.
00:11:42.236 And so this is a gem.
00:11:43.234 We do need to take care of it.
00:11:46.038 And as we enter the Anthropocene,
00:11:48.232 as we get, as we humans have gotten
00:11:51.013 so sophisticated and large and impactful,
00:11:55.837 as we stride across this planet, you know,
00:11:58.774 that is going to, as we continue,
00:12:01.832 we want to use a lot of energy.
00:12:03.436 We want to use a lot of energy per capita.
00:12:04.956 We\'ve gotten amazing things.
00:12:07.133 We don\'t want to go backwards.
00:12:09.693 You know, if you thinkabout the good old days,
00:12:15.609 they\'re mostly an illusion.
00:12:17.373 Like in almost every way,
00:12:19.237 life is better for almost everyone today
00:12:21.170 than it was say, 50 yearsago or a hundred years.
00:12:25.094 We live better lives by andlarge than our grandparents did,
00:12:29.697 and their grandparents did, and so on.
00:12:31.636 And you can see that inglobal illiteracy rates,
00:12:34.039 global poverty rates, globalinfant mortality rates,
00:12:39.113 like almost any metric you choose,
00:12:41.174 we\'re better off than we used to be.
00:12:43.377 And we get, you know, antibiotics
00:12:45.255 and all kinds of lifesaving medical care
00:12:46.776 and so on and so on.
00:12:49.070 And there\'s one thingthat is moving backwards,
00:12:52.935 and it\'s the natural world.
00:12:54.653 So it is a fact that 500years ago, pre-industrial age,
00:12:59.794 the natural world was pristine.
00:13:02.121 It was incredible.
00:13:03.697 And we have traded someof that pristine beauty
00:13:09.055 for all of these other gifts that we have
00:13:11.331 as an advanced society.
00:13:13.513 And we can have both.
00:13:16.155 But to do that, we have to go to space.
00:13:18.837 And all of this, really,
00:13:20.375 the most fundamental measureis energy usage per capita.
00:13:25.698 And when you look at, you know,
00:13:27.399 you do want to continue touse more and more energy,
00:13:30.551 it is going to make yourlife better in so many ways.
00:13:33.494 But that\'s not compatible ultimately
00:13:36.333 with living on a finite planet.
00:13:38.074 And so we have to go outinto the solar system
00:13:40.895 and really you could argueabout when you have to do that,
00:13:44.773 but you can\'t credibly argue
00:13:47.235 about whether you have to do that.
00:13:49.615 Eventually, we have to do that.
00:13:51.157 Exactly.
00:13:52.314 Well, you don\'t often talk about it,
00:13:54.439 but let me ask you on thattopic about the Blue Ring
00:13:56.990 and the orbital reef spaceinfrastructure projects.
00:14:01.375 What\'s your vision for these?
00:14:03.511 So Blue Ring is a veryinteresting spacecraft
00:14:07.117 that is designed to take upto 3000 kilograms of payload
00:14:12.736 up to geosynchronous orbitor in lunar vicinity.
00:14:17.075 It has two different kinds of propulsion.
00:14:20.253 It has chemical propulsion,and it has electric propulsion.
00:14:24.391 And so it can,
00:14:25.814 you can use blue ring ina couple different ways.
00:14:28.996 You can slowly move, let\'ssay up to geosynchronous orbit
00:14:32.717 using electric propulsion
00:14:34.679 that might take you know, a hundred days
00:14:36.838 or 150 days depending on howmuch mass you\'re carrying.
00:14:40.275 And then, and reserveyour chemical propulsion
00:14:43.171 so that you can change orbits quickly
00:14:44.994 in geosynchronous orbit.
00:14:46.834 Or you can use thechemical propulsion first
00:14:49.412 to quickly get up to geosynchronous
00:14:51.136 and then use your electrical propulsion
00:14:53.089 to slowly change yourgeosynchronous orbit.
00:14:55.797 Blue Ring has a coupleof interesting features.
00:14:59.276 It provides a lot of services
00:15:04.050 to these payloads.
00:15:05.382 So the payload, it couldbe one large payload,
00:15:07.433 or it can be a number of small payloads,
00:15:10.312 and it provides thermal management,
00:15:12.336 it provides electricpower, it provides compute,
00:15:16.695 provides communications.
00:15:19.035 And so when you designa payload for Blue Ring,
00:15:23.115 you don\'t have,
00:15:24.253 you don\'t have to figureout all of those things
00:15:27.237 on your own.
00:15:28.236 So kind of radiation tolerant compute
00:15:30.917 is a complicated thing to do.
00:15:32.974 And so we have an unusually large amount
00:15:36.438 of radiation tolerantcompute on board Blue Ring,
00:15:39.033 and you can, yourpayload can just use that
00:15:41.639 when it needs to.
00:15:42.690 So it\'s sort of all these services,
00:15:46.734 it\'s you know, it\'s like a set of APIs.
00:15:49.650 It\'s a little bit likeAmazon web services,
00:15:51.676 but for space payloadsthat need to move about
00:15:55.055 an earth vicinity or lunar vicinity.
00:15:57.795 AWSS space.
00:15:59.922 Okay, so computing space.
00:16:02.932 So you get a giant chemical rocket
00:16:04.836 to get a payload out to orbit,
00:16:08.035 and then you have theseadmins that show up,
00:16:11.129 this Blue Ring thing thatmanages various things
00:16:13.810 like compute.
00:16:14.643 Exactly.
00:16:15.476 And it can also provide transportation
00:16:16.893 and move you around to different orbits.
00:16:19.012 Including humans, you think?
00:16:20.195 No, but Blue Ring is notdesigned to move humans around.
00:16:23.726 It\'s designed to move payloads around.
00:16:26.854 Okay.
00:16:27.687 So we\'re also building a lunar lander,
00:16:29.749 which is of course designed to land humans
00:16:33.640 on the surface of the moon.
00:16:34.917 I\'m gonna ask you about that,
00:16:36.578 but let me ask you to juststep back to the old days.
00:16:40.595 You were at Princeton
00:16:42.476 with aspirations to bea theoretical physicist.
00:16:45.386 Yeah.
00:16:47.533 What attracted you to physics
00:16:49.368 and why did you change your mind
00:16:51.798 and not become, why you\'re not Jeff Bezos,
00:16:54.808 the famous theoretical physicist?
00:16:57.116 So I loved physics and I studied physics
00:16:59.969 and computer science,
00:17:01.638 and I was proceedingalong the physics path.
00:17:05.114 I was planning to major in physics
00:17:06.531 and I wanted to be atheoretical physicist.
00:17:08.907 And the computer science
00:17:10.374 was sort of something I was doing for fun.
00:17:12.655 I really loved it.
00:17:14.577 And I was very good at the programming
00:17:17.867 and doing those things.
00:17:19.674 And I enjoyed all my computerscience classes immensely,
00:17:23.035 but I really was determinedto be a theoretical physicist.
00:17:26.355 It\'s why I went to Princetonin the first place.
00:17:29.014 It was definitely, and then I realized
00:17:32.596 I was gonna be a mediocretheoretical physicist.
00:17:35.510 And there were a few people in my classes,
00:17:39.115 like in quantum mechanics and so on,
00:17:42.049 who they could effortlessly do things
00:17:44.493 that were so difficult for me.
00:17:46.470 And I realized like you know,there are a thousand ways
00:17:49.575 to be smart and to be a really, you know,
00:17:52.455 theoretical physics isnot one of those fields
00:17:56.013 where only the top few percent
00:17:59.877 actually move the stateof the art forward.
00:18:02.372 It\'s one of those thingswhere you have to be
00:18:05.011 really just, your brain hasto be wired in a certain way.
00:18:09.214 And there was a guy named,
00:18:10.932 one of these people who convinced me.
00:18:14.519 He didn\'t mean to convince me,
00:18:16.142 but just by observing him, he convinced me
00:18:17.915 that I should not try tobe a theoretical physicist.
00:18:20.835 His name was Yosanta.
00:18:22.519 And Yosanta was from Sri Lanka.
00:18:26.887 And he was one of the mostbrilliant people I\'d ever met.
00:18:30.608 My friend Joe and I wereworking on a very difficult
00:18:34.936 partial differential equationsproblem set one night.
00:18:37.899 And there was one problem thatwe worked on for three hours,
00:18:41.890 and we made no headway whatsoever.
00:18:45.594 And we looked up at eachother at the same time
00:18:48.333 and we said, Yosanta.
00:18:49.628 So we went to Yosanta\'s dorm room.
00:18:51.875 And he was there, hewas almost always there.
00:18:54.848 And we said Yosanta, we\'rehaving trouble solving
00:18:57.558 this partial differential equation,
00:19:00.655 would you mind taking a look?
00:19:02.599 And he said of course.
00:19:03.528 By the way, he was the mosthumble, most kind person.
00:19:07.716 And so he took our,
00:19:08.854 he looked at our problemand he stared at it
00:19:11.913 for just a few seconds, maybe 10 seconds.
00:19:13.730 And he said cosine.
00:19:15.797 And I said, what do you mean Yosanta?
00:19:17.892 What do you mean cosine?
00:19:18.888 He said that\'s the answer.
00:19:19.767 And I said no, no, no, come on.
00:19:21.596 And he said let me show you.
00:19:22.838 And he took out some paper
00:19:24.133 and he wrote down threepages of equations,
00:19:27.651 everything canceled out.
00:19:29.428 And the answer was cosine.
00:19:30.919 And I said Yosanta, didyou do that in your head?
00:19:35.714 And he said oh no, thatwould be impossible.
00:19:38.152 A few years ago I solved a similar problem
00:19:40.954 and I could map thisproblem onto that problem.
00:19:43.777 And then it was immediately obvious
00:19:45.397 that the answer was cosine.
00:19:47.434 I had a few, you know, youhave an experience like that,
00:19:50.389 you realize maybe beinga theoretical physicist
00:19:54.277 isn\'t what your,
00:19:55.555 isn\'t what the universe wants you to be.
00:19:59.351 And so I switched to computerscience and you know,
00:20:04.253 that worked out really well for me.
00:20:05.755 I enjoy it.
00:20:06.588 I still enjoy it today.
00:20:07.523 Yeah, there\'s a particularkind of intuition you need
00:20:09.638 to be a great physicist,applied to physics.
00:20:12.657 I think the mathematicalskill required today is so high.
00:20:17.529 You have to be a world-class mathematician
00:20:20.929 to be a successfultheoretical physicist today.
00:20:24.313 And it\'s not you know,
00:20:26.871 you probably need other skills too,
00:20:29.971 intuition, lateral thinking, and so on.
00:20:32.722 But without just top-notch math skills,
00:20:37.127 you\'re unlikely to be successful.
00:20:39.319 And visualization skill,
00:20:40.847 you have to be able to really kind of do
00:20:43.589 these kinds of thought experiments.
00:20:45.333 And if you want truly great creativity,
00:20:46.918 actually Walter Isaacson writes about you.
00:20:49.571 It puts you on the same level as Einstein.
00:20:52.530 Well, that\'s very kind.
00:20:56.407 I\'m an inventor.
00:20:57.587 If you wanna boil down what I am,
00:21:00.833 I\'m really an inventor.
00:21:02.493 And I look at things
00:21:03.900 and I can come up with atypicalsolutions and you know,
00:21:08.756 and then I can create ahundred such atypical solutions
00:21:11.815 for something.
00:21:13.458 99 of them may not survive,you know, scrutiny.
00:21:18.657 But one of those 100 islike hmm, maybe there is,
00:21:21.957 maybe that might work.
00:21:23.570 And then you can keep going from there.
00:21:25.417 So that kind of lateral thinking,
00:21:27.695 that kind of inventiveness
00:21:29.811 in a high dimensionalityspace where the search space
00:21:33.811 is very large, that\'s wheremy inventive skills come.
00:21:37.489 That\'s the thing is I self-identify
00:21:40.640 as an inventor more than anything else.
00:21:43.354 Yeah, and he describes inall kinds of different ways,
00:21:45.991 Walter Isaacson does that creativity
00:21:50.448 combined with childlikewander that you\'ve maintained
00:21:54.436 still to this day, all ofthat combined together.
00:21:57.274 Is there, like if you were to study
00:21:59.297 your own brain introspect,how do you think,
00:22:02.171 what\'s your thinking process like?
00:22:03.654 We\'ll talk about the writing process
00:22:05.716 of putting it down on paper,
00:22:07.514 which is quite rigorousand famous at Amazon.
00:22:12.874 But how do you, when yousit down, maybe alone,
00:22:15.829 maybe with others,
00:22:17.059 and thinking through thishigh dimensional space
00:22:19.573 and looking for creativesolutions, creative paths forward,
00:22:24.053 is there something you couldsay about that process?
00:22:26.314 It\'s such a good question,
00:22:27.994 and I honestly don\'t know how it works.
00:22:31.091 If I did, I would try to explain it.
00:22:32.931 I know it involves lots of wandering.
00:22:35.426 Yeah.
00:22:37.294 So I, you know, when I sitdown to work on a problem,
00:22:40.307 I know I don\'t know where I\'m going.
00:22:43.592 So to go in a straightline, to be efficient,
00:22:47.273 efficiency and inventionare sort of at odds
00:22:50.693 because invention, real invention,
00:22:53.298 not incremental improvement.
00:22:54.633 Incremental improvement is so important
00:22:56.584 in every endeavor, in everything you do.
00:22:58.687 You have to work hard onalso just making things
00:23:00.346 a little bit better.
00:23:02.337 But I\'m talking about real invention,
00:23:04.775 real lateral thinking,that requires wandering.
00:23:08.693 And you have to give yourselfpermission to wander.
00:23:11.294 I think a lot of people,
00:23:15.398 they feel like wandering is inefficient.
00:23:20.233 And you know, like whenI sit down at a meeting,
00:23:26.250 I don\'t know how longthe meeting is gonna take
00:23:28.598 if we\'re trying to solve a problem.
00:23:30.356 Because if I did, then I\'d already,
00:23:33.991 I\'d know there\'s somekind of straight line
00:23:35.689 that we\'re drawing to the solution.
00:23:38.014 The reality is we may haveto wander for a long time.
00:23:42.270 And I do like group invention.
00:23:43.836 I think there\'s certainly nothing more fun
00:23:46.919 than sitting at awhiteboard with you know,
00:23:49.635 a group of smart people and spit balling
00:23:53.673 and coming up with new ideasand objections to those ideas,
00:23:57.571 and then solutions to the objections
00:24:00.015 and going back and forth.
00:24:02.076 So like you know, sometimesyou wake up with an idea
00:24:06.217 in the middle of the night
00:24:08.531 and sometimes you sit downwith a group of people
00:24:10.871 and go back and forth
00:24:12.316 and both things are really pleasurable.
00:24:14.754 And when you wander,
00:24:16.031 I think one key thingis to notice a good idea
00:24:21.958 and to maybe, to noticethe kernel of a good idea.
00:24:25.832 Maybe pull at that string.
00:24:28.076 Because I don\'t think a goodidea has come fully formed.
00:24:31.414 A hundred percent right.
00:24:33.411 In fact, when I come up withwhat I think is a good idea
00:24:37.515 and it survives kind of thefirst level of scrutiny,
00:24:40.975 you know, that I do in my own head
00:24:42.635 and I\'m ready to tellsomebody else about the idea,
00:24:45.855 I will often say look,
00:24:47.297 it is going to be really easyfor you to find objections
00:24:50.292 to this idea, but work with me.
00:24:53.154 There\'s something there.
00:24:54.531 There\'s something there.
00:24:55.638 And that is intuition.
00:24:57.653 Yeah.
00:24:58.486 Because it\'s reallyeasy to kill new ideas
00:25:01.716 in the beginning.
00:25:02.738 \'Cause they do have so many,
00:25:04.677 so many easy objections to them.
00:25:07.138 So you need to,
00:25:08.130 you need to kind of forewarn people
00:25:09.932 and say look, I know it\'sgonna take a lot of work
00:25:12.496 to get this to a fully formed idea.
00:25:14.853 Let\'s get started on that.
00:25:16.014 It\'ll be fun.
00:25:17.373 So you got that ability to say cosine
00:25:19.808 in you somewhere after all.
00:25:22.053 Maybe not on math, but-
00:25:23.333 In a different domain.
00:25:24.179 Yeah.
00:25:25.264 There are a thousand waysto be smart, by the way.
00:25:27.600 Yeah.
00:25:28.433 And that is a really, likewhen I go around, you know,
00:25:31.803 and I meet people, I\'m always looking
00:25:33.620 for the way that they\'re smart.
00:25:35.704 And you find it is,
00:25:37.083 that\'s one of the things thatmakes the world so interesting
00:25:42.182 and fun is that it is not,
00:25:43.936 it\'s not like IQ is a single dimension.
00:25:48.800 There are people who aresmart in such unique ways.
00:25:52.975 Yeah, you just gave me a good response
00:25:54.640 to when somebody calls mean idiot on the internet.
00:25:57.308 You know, that\'s a thousandways to be smart, sir.
00:26:01.123 Well, they might tell you,
00:26:02.947 yeah, but there are a millionto be ways to be dumb.
00:26:04.473 Yeah, right.
00:26:06.347 I feel like that\'s a Mark Twain quote.
00:26:08.889 Okay.
00:26:10.563 All right, you gave me an amazing tour
00:26:12.322 of Blue Origin RocketFactory and Launch Complex
00:26:14.638 in the historic Cape Canaveral.
00:26:17.024 That\'s where New Glenn,
00:26:18.766 the big rocket we talkedabout is being built
00:26:22.882 and will launch.
00:26:24.524 Can you explain whatthe New Glenn Rocket is
00:26:26.707 and tell me some interestingtechnical aspects
00:26:28.635 of how it works?
00:26:29.702 Sure.
00:26:31.081 New Glenn is a very large,
00:26:35.141 a heavy lift launch vehicle.
00:26:37.643 It\'ll take about 45 metric tons to LEO,
00:26:41.440 very, very large class.
00:26:44.302 It\'s about half the thrust,
00:26:46.664 a little more than half the thrust
00:26:48.145 of the Saturn V Rocket.
00:26:50.576 So it\'s about 3.9 millionpounds of thrust on liftoff.
00:26:55.360 The booster has seven BE-4 engines.
00:26:59.941 Each engine generates a little more
00:27:02.141 than 550,000 pounds of thrust.
00:27:05.507 The engines are fueledby liquid natural gas,
00:27:09.359 liquified natural gas, LNG as the fuel
00:27:12.475 and LOX as the oxidizer.
00:27:15.257 The cycle is an ox-richedstage combustion cycle.
00:27:19.283 It\'s a cycle that was reallypioneered by the Russians.
00:27:21.858 It\'s a very good cycle.
00:27:23.642 And that engine is also goingto power the first stage
00:27:29.501 of the Vulcan rocket,
00:27:30.738 which is the UnitedLaunch Alliance rocket.
00:27:33.302 Then the second stage of New Glenn
00:27:36.452 is powered by two BE-3U engines,
00:27:39.307 which is a upper stage variant
00:27:41.620 of our New Shephardliquid hydrogen engine.
00:27:44.424 So the BE-3U has 160,000 pounds of thrust.
00:27:47.826 So two of those 320,000 pounds of thrust
00:27:51.920 and hydrogen is a very good propellant
00:27:54.985 for upper stages becauseit has very high ISP.
00:27:59.122 It\'s not a great propellantin my view for booster stages
00:28:03.920 because the stages thenget physically so large.
00:28:06.901 Hydrogen has very high ISP,
00:28:10.163 but liquid hydrogen is very,
00:28:12.767 is not dense at all.
00:28:14.825 So to store liquid hydrogen, you know,
00:28:17.377 if you need to store many thousands
00:28:19.074 of pounds of liquid hydrogen,
00:28:20.081 your tanks, your liquidhydrogen tank, it\'s very large.
00:28:23.099 So you really, you get morebenefit from the higher ISP,
00:28:27.252 the specific impulse.
00:28:29.064 You get more benefit fromthe higher specific impulse
00:28:31.719 on the second stage.
00:28:33.906 And that stage carries less propellant.
00:28:37.563 So you don\'t get suchgeometrically gigantic tanks.
00:28:41.040 The Delta IV is an example of a vehicle
00:28:44.064 that is all hydrogen.
00:28:45.266 The booster stage is also hydrogen.
00:28:47.582 And I think that it\'s avery effective vehicle,
00:28:49.985 but it never was very cost effective.
00:28:52.801 So it\'s operationally very capable
00:28:55.400 but not very cost effective.
00:28:56.899 So size is also costly.
00:28:58.559 Size is costly.
00:28:59.761 So it\'s interesting.
00:29:01.503 Rockets love to be big.
00:29:03.578 Everything works better.
00:29:05.199 What do you mean by that?
00:29:06.361 You\'ve told me that before.
00:29:07.478 It sounds epic, but what does it mean?
00:29:10.054 I mean, when you look at the,
00:29:12.239 kind of the physics of rocket engines
00:29:15.922 and also when you look at parasitic mass,
00:29:19.742 it doesn\'t, if you have,
00:29:20.862 let\'s say you have an avionic system,
00:29:22.499 so you have a guidance and control system,
00:29:25.059 that is gonna be aboutthe same mass and size
00:29:29.506 for a giant rocket as it isgonna be for a tiny rocket.
00:29:33.555 And so that\'s just parasitic mass
00:29:37.119 that is very consequentialif you\'re building
00:29:40.083 a very small rocket,
00:29:41.206 but is trivial if you\'rebuilding a very large rocket.
00:29:44.098 So you have the parasitic mass thing.
00:29:46.323 And then if you look at, for example,
00:29:48.099 rocket engines have turbo pumps.
00:29:50.559 They have to pressurizethe fuel and the oxidizer
00:29:53.800 up to a very high pressure level
00:29:55.779 in order to inject itinto the thrust chamber
00:29:58.101 where it burns.
00:29:59.927 And those pumps, allrotating machines, in fact
00:30:03.523 get more efficient as they get larger.
00:30:06.765 So really tiny turbo pumps
00:30:09.668 are very challenging to manufacture.
