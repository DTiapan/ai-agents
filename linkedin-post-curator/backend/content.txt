00:00:00.233 The following is aconversation with Jeff Bezos,
00:00:03.286 founder of Amazon and Blue Origin.
00:00:06.322 This is his first timedoing a conversation
00:00:09.256 of this kind and of this length.
00:00:11.380 And as he told me, it felt likewe could have easily talked
00:00:14.214 for many more hours, and I'm sure we will.
00:00:17.801 This is the Lex Fridman podcast.
00:00:19.856 And now, dear friends, here's Jeff Bezos.
00:00:24.599 You spent a lot of yourchildhood with your grandfather
00:00:27.734 on a ranch here in Texas,
00:00:30.294 and I heard you had a lot ofwork to do around the ranch.
00:00:33.057 So what's the coolest jobyou remember doing there?
00:00:35.437 Wow, coolest.
00:00:36.659 Most interesting.
00:00:38.087 Most memorable.
00:00:39.091 Most memorable.
00:00:40.089 Most impactful.
00:00:41.308 And it was a real working ranch.
00:00:42.999 My grand, I spent allmy summers on that ranch
00:00:46.753 from age four to 16.
00:00:49.276 And my grandfather wasreally taking me to those
00:00:52.933 in the summers, in the early summers,
00:00:54.378 he was letting me pretendto help on the ranch.
00:00:57.658 'Cause of course, a4-year-old is a burden,
00:00:59.376 not a help in real life.
00:01:01.233 He was really just watchingme and taking care of me
00:01:04.944 and be was doing thatbecause my mom was so young.
00:01:07.996 She had me when she was 17,
00:01:09.953 and so he was sort of giving her a break.
00:01:12.037 And my grandmother and my grandfather
00:01:13.433 would take me for these summers.
00:01:15.056 But as I got a little older,
00:01:16.251 I actually was helpful onthe ranch and I loved it.
00:01:18.718 I was out there,
00:01:20.193 like my grandfather hada huge influence on me,
00:01:23.604 huge factor in my life.
00:01:25.516 I did all the jobs youwould do on a ranch.
00:01:28.895 I've fixed windmills and laid fences
00:01:33.132 and pipelines and youknow, done all the things
00:01:36.557 that any rancher would do,
00:01:38.096 vaccinated, the animals, everything.
00:01:41.596 But we had a you know, my grandfather,
00:01:44.136 after my grandmother died, I was about 12
00:01:47.215 and I kept coming to the ranch.
00:01:48.617 So it was then, it was justhim and me, just the two of us.
00:01:51.254 And he was completelyaddicted to the soap opera,
00:01:55.916 the Days of Our Lives.
00:01:57.673 And we would go back tothe ranch house every day
00:02:00.706 around 1:00 PM or so towatch days of our lives
00:02:03.980 like sands through an hourglass.
00:02:06.433 So are the days of our lives.
00:02:07.974 Just the image of the two sitting there
00:02:11.296 watching a soap opera as ranchers.
00:02:12.953 He had these big, crazy dogs.
00:02:14.434 It was really a veryformative experience for me.
00:02:16.617 But the key thing about it for me,
00:02:18.677 the great gift I got from it
00:02:21.935 was that my grandfather wasso resourceful, you know,
00:02:25.732 he did everything himself.
00:02:26.895 He made his own veterinary tools.
00:02:28.591 He would make needles tosuture the cattle up with,
00:02:32.157 like he would find a littlepiece of wire and heat it up
00:02:34.287 and pound it thin and drilla hole in it and sharpen it.
00:02:37.239 So, you know, you learn different things
00:02:40.295 on a ranch than you would learn
00:02:41.881 you know, growing up in a city.
00:02:43.412 So self-reliance.
00:02:44.567 Yeah, like figuring outthat you can solve problems
00:02:48.271 with enough persistence and ingenuity.
00:02:52.127 And my grandfather bought a D6 bulldozer,
00:02:55.573 which is a big bulldozer, andhe got it for like $5,000.
00:02:58.511 'cause it was completely broken down.
00:03:00.392 It was like a 1955Caterpillar, D6 bulldozer
00:03:04.589 knew it would've cost, I don't know,
00:03:06.394 more than a $100,000.
00:03:08.012 And we spent an entire summer fixing,
00:03:10.887 like repairing that bulldozer.
00:03:13.170 And we'd, you know, use mail order
00:03:15.549 to buy big gears for the transmission.
00:03:17.633 And they'd show up.
00:03:18.749 They'd be too heavy to move,
00:03:19.873 so we'd have to build a crane, you know,
00:03:21.911 just that kind of, kinda thatproblem solving mentality.
00:03:26.131 He had it so powerfully, you know,
00:03:30.589 he did all of his own.
00:03:31.939 He'd just, he didn't pick upthe phone and call somebody.
00:03:35.448 He would figure it out on his own.
00:03:37.370 Doing his own veterinary work, you know.
00:03:39.389 But just the image of the two of you
00:03:41.009 fixing a D6 bulldozer and then going in
00:03:43.684 for a little break at 1:00PM to watch a soap opera.
00:03:46.578 Laying on the floor.
00:03:48.710 That's how he watched TV.
00:03:50.093 Yeah.
00:03:50.926 He was a really, really remarkable guy.
00:03:52.468 That's how I imagine Clint Eastwood also
00:03:55.759 in all those westerns.
00:03:57.657 When he's not doing what he is doing,
00:03:59.788 he's just watching soap operas.
00:04:01.447 All right, I read that you fell in love
00:04:04.325 with the idea of spaceand space exploration
00:04:05.886 when you were five watching Neil Armstrong
00:04:07.616 walking on the moon.
00:04:10.953 So let me ask you to lookback at the historical context
00:04:14.766 and impact of that.
00:04:16.317 So the space race from 1957 to 1969
00:04:21.033 between the Soviet Union andthe US was in many ways epic.
00:04:25.717 It was a rapid sequence of dramatic events
00:04:29.216 for satellite to space,for a human to space,
00:04:32.075 for a spacewalk, firstuncrewed landing on the moon,
00:04:35.538 then some failures, explosions,
00:04:38.373 deaths on both sides actually,
00:04:40.416 and then the first humanwalking on the moon.
00:04:43.801 What are some of themore inspiring moments
00:04:46.134 or insights you take away from that time,
00:04:47.737 those few years, that just 12 years?
00:04:51.120 Well, I mean, there'sso much inspiring there.
00:04:55.678 You know, one of the greatthings to take away from that,
00:04:57.419 one of the great von Braun quotes is
00:04:59.405 "I have come to use the wordimpossible with great caution."
00:05:04.461 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:05:07.520 And so that's kind ofthe big story of Apollo
00:05:10.480 is that things, youknow, going to the moon
00:05:13.775 was literally an analogy that people used
00:05:17.243 for something that's impossible.
00:05:19.002 You know, oh yeah, you'lldo that when you know,
00:05:21.382 men walk on the moon.
00:05:22.464 Yeah.
00:05:23.297 And of course it finally happened.
00:05:26.134 So, you know, I think itwas pulled forward in time
00:05:29.069 because of the space race,
00:05:31.513 I think you know, with thegeopolitical implications
00:05:34.972 and you know, how muchresource was put into it,
00:05:37.730 you know, at the peak,that program was spending,
00:05:39.902 you know, two or 3% ofGDP on the Apollo program.
00:05:43.970 So much resource.
00:05:45.604 I think it was pulled forward in time.
00:05:47.511 You know, we kind of did it ahead
00:05:50.529 of when we quote unquoteshould have done it.
00:05:52.639 Yeah.
00:05:53.472 And so in that way, it'salso a technical marvel.
00:05:57.022 I mean, it's truly incredible.
00:05:58.971 It's, you know, it'sthe 20th century version
00:06:03.109 of building the pyramids or something.
00:06:04.935 It's you know, it's an achievement
00:06:07.530 that because it was pulled forward in time
00:06:09.335 and because it did something
00:06:10.676 that had previously thought impossible,
00:06:12.615 it rightly deservesits place, as you know,
00:06:14.832 in the pantheon of greathuman achievements.
00:06:17.758 And of course, you namedthe projects The Rockets
00:06:21.293 that Blue Origin is working on
00:06:22.971 after some of the folks involved.
00:06:23.999 Yeah.
00:06:24.832 I don't understand whyI didn't say New Gagarin.
00:06:26.477 is that-
00:06:27.310 There's an American bias in the naming.
00:06:28.654 I apologize.
00:06:29.653 It's very strange.
00:06:30.808 Lex.
00:06:31.641 Just asking for a friend.
00:06:33.348 Clarify.
00:06:34.181 I'm a big fan of Gagarin though.
00:06:36.031 And in fact, I think hisfirst words in space,
00:06:41.010 I think are incredible.
00:06:43.752 He, you know, he purportedlysaid "my God, it's blue."
00:06:47.692 And that really drives home.
00:06:49.643 No one had seen the earth from space.
00:06:52.446 No one knew that we wereon this blue planet.
00:06:55.442 Yeah.
00:06:56.275 No one knew what itlooked like from out there.
00:06:58.129 And Gagarin was thefirst person to see it.
00:07:01.027 One of the things I thinkabout is how dangerous
00:07:04.114 those early days were for Gagarin,
00:07:06.989 for Glen, for everybody involved.
00:07:08.729 Like how big of a riskthey were all taking.
00:07:11.229 They were taking huge risks.
00:07:12.429 I'm not sure what the Soviets thought
00:07:14.826 about Gagarin's flight,
00:07:16.653 but I think that the Americans thought
00:07:19.009 that the Alan Shephard flight,
00:07:20.833 the flight that you know,New Shephard is named after,
00:07:22.653 the first American in space.
00:07:24.133 He went on his suborbital flight.
00:07:26.330 They thought he had abouta 75% chance of success.
00:07:31.080 So, you know, that's apretty big risk, a 25% risk.
00:07:36.115 It's kind of interestingthat Alan Shephard
00:07:38.351 is not quite as famous as John Glenn.
00:07:40.030 So for people who don'tknow, Alan Shephard
00:07:42.033 is the first astronaut-
00:07:44.707 The first American in space.
00:07:46.491 American in suborbital flight.
00:07:48.610 Correct.
00:07:49.443 And then the first orbital flight is-
00:07:51.030 John Glenn is the firstAmerican to orbit the earth.
00:07:54.833 By the way, I have themost charming, sweet,
00:07:58.048 incredible letter from John Glenn,
00:08:00.987 which I have framed andhang on my office wall.
00:08:03.987 What did he say?
00:08:04.991 Where he tells me how grateful he is
00:08:07.807 that we have named New Glenn after him.
00:08:10.610 And he sent me that letterabout a week before he died.
00:08:13.642 And it's really an incredible,
00:08:15.806 it's also a very funny letter.
00:08:17.071 He's writing and he says you know,
00:08:20.392 this is a letter about NewGlenn from the original Glenn.
00:08:24.113 And he's just, he's gota great sense of humor,
00:08:26.983 and he's very happy about it and grateful.
00:08:29.226 It's very sweet.
00:08:30.271 Does he say ps don't mess this up?
00:08:31.810 Or is that-
00:08:34.201 No, he doesn't.
00:08:35.140 Make me look good.
00:08:36.015 He doesn't do that.
00:08:37.158 Okay.
00:08:37.991 But wait, but John, wherever you are,
00:08:38.823 we got you covered.
00:08:39.657 All right, good.
00:08:41.530 So back to maybe the big picture of space.
00:08:44.295 When you look up at thestars and think big,
00:08:47.912 what do you hope isthe future of humanity?
00:08:49.891 Hundreds, thousands ofyears from now out in space?
00:08:54.135 I would love to see, you know,
00:08:56.528 a trillion humans livingin the solar system.
00:09:01.566 If we had a trillion humans,
00:09:03.251 we would have at any giventime a thousand Mozarts
00:09:06.314 and a thousand Einsteins.
00:09:08.473 That would, you know, our solarsystem would be full of life
00:09:11.736 and intelligence and energy.
00:09:14.116 And we can easily supporta civilization that large
00:09:17.773 with all of the resourcesin the solar system.
00:09:21.314 So what do you think that looks like?
00:09:23.289 Giant space stations?
00:09:24.633 Yeah, the only way to get to that vision
00:09:26.695 is with giant space stations.
00:09:28.796 You know, the planetarysurfaces are just way too small.
00:09:31.397 So you can, I mean, unless you turn them
00:09:34.130 into giant space stations or something.
00:09:36.608 But, but yeah, we will takematerials from the moon
00:09:40.853 and from near earth objectsand from the asteroid belt
00:09:44.679 and so on, and we'll buildgiant O'Neill style colonies
00:09:49.091 and people will live in those.
00:09:50.919 And they have a lot of advantagesover planetary surfaces.
00:09:54.013 You can spin them to getnormal earth gravity.
00:09:57.734 You can put them where you want them.
00:09:59.398 I think most people aregonna wanna live near Earth,
00:10:03.112 not necessarily in earthorbit, but in you know, earth,
00:10:07.808 but near earth vicinity orbits.
00:10:10.700 And so they can move youknow, relatively quickly
00:10:15.251 back and forth betweentheir station and Earth.
00:10:19.137 So I think a lot of people,
00:10:20.455 especially in the early stages,
00:10:21.813 are not gonna want togive up Earth altogether.
00:10:24.894 They go to earth for vacation.
00:10:26.695 Yeah.
00:10:27.528 Same way that you know, you might go
00:10:29.157 to Yellowstone National Park for vacation.
00:10:31.389 People will, and no one,
00:10:33.210 and people will get to choosewhere they live on earth
00:10:35.693 or whether they live in space,
00:10:37.853 but they'll be able touse much more energy
00:10:40.575 and much more material resource in space
00:10:42.920 than they would be able to use on earth.
00:10:45.514 One of the interesting ideas you had
00:10:47.048 is to move the heavyindustry away from Earth.
00:10:49.810 So people sometimes have this idea
00:10:52.034 that somehow spaceexploration is in conflict
00:10:55.912 with the celebration of the planet earth,
00:10:58.593 that we should focus on preserving earth.
00:11:00.559 And basically your ideas that space travel
00:11:04.321 and space exploration isa way to preserve earth.
00:11:06.773 Exactly.
00:11:07.872 This planet, we've sent roboticprobes to all the planets.
00:11:13.159 We know that this is the good one.
00:11:16.380 Yeah.
00:11:17.595 Not to play favorites or anything.
00:11:19.088 But earth really is the good planet.
00:11:20.850 It's amazing, the ecosystem we have here,
00:11:24.258 all of the life and thelush, the plant life
00:11:28.810 and you know, the waterresources, everything.
00:11:30.764 This planet is really extraordinary.
00:11:33.273 And of course, we evolved on this planet,
00:11:35.159 so of course it's perfect for us,
00:11:37.394 but it's also perfect forall the advanced life forms
00:11:39.670 on this planet, all the animals and so on.
00:11:42.236 And so this is a gem.
00:11:43.234 We do need to take care of it.
00:11:46.038 And as we enter the Anthropocene,
00:11:48.232 as we get, as we humans have gotten
00:11:51.013 so sophisticated and large and impactful,
00:11:55.837 as we stride across this planet, you know,
00:11:58.774 that is going to, as we continue,
00:12:01.832 we want to use a lot of energy.
00:12:03.436 We want to use a lot of energy per capita.
00:12:04.956 We've gotten amazing things.
00:12:07.133 We don't want to go backwards.
00:12:09.693 You know, if you thinkabout the good old days,
00:12:15.609 they're mostly an illusion.
00:12:17.373 Like in almost every way,
00:12:19.237 life is better for almost everyone today
00:12:21.170 than it was say, 50 yearsago or a hundred years.
00:12:25.094 We live better lives by andlarge than our grandparents did,
00:12:29.697 and their grandparents did, and so on.
00:12:31.636 And you can see that inglobal illiteracy rates,
00:12:34.039 global poverty rates, globalinfant mortality rates,
00:12:39.113 like almost any metric you choose,
00:12:41.174 we're better off than we used to be.
00:12:43.377 And we get, you know, antibiotics
00:12:45.255 and all kinds of lifesaving medical care
00:12:46.776 and so on and so on.
00:12:49.070 And there's one thingthat is moving backwards,
00:12:52.935 and it's the natural world.
00:12:54.653 So it is a fact that 500years ago, pre-industrial age,
00:12:59.794 the natural world was pristine.
00:13:02.121 It was incredible.
00:13:03.697 And we have traded someof that pristine beauty
00:13:09.055 for all of these other gifts that we have
00:13:11.331 as an advanced society.
00:13:13.513 And we can have both.
00:13:16.155 But to do that, we have to go to space.
00:13:18.837 And all of this, really,
00:13:20.375 the most fundamental measureis energy usage per capita.
00:13:25.698 And when you look at, you know,
00:13:27.399 you do want to continue touse more and more energy,
00:13:30.551 it is going to make yourlife better in so many ways.
00:13:33.494 But that's not compatible ultimately
00:13:36.333 with living on a finite planet.
00:13:38.074 And so we have to go outinto the solar system
00:13:40.895 and really you could argueabout when you have to do that,
00:13:44.773 but you can't credibly argue
00:13:47.235 about whether you have to do that.
00:13:49.615 Eventually, we have to do that.
00:13:51.157 Exactly.
00:13:52.314 Well, you don't often talk about it,
00:13:54.439 but let me ask you on thattopic about the Blue Ring
00:13:56.990 and the orbital reef spaceinfrastructure projects.
00:14:01.375 What's your vision for these?
00:14:03.511 So Blue Ring is a veryinteresting spacecraft
00:14:07.117 that is designed to take upto 3000 kilograms of payload
00:14:12.736 up to geosynchronous orbitor in lunar vicinity.
00:14:17.075 It has two different kinds of propulsion.
00:14:20.253 It has chemical propulsion,and it has electric propulsion.
00:14:24.391 And so it can,
00:14:25.814 you can use blue ring ina couple different ways.
00:14:28.996 You can slowly move, let'ssay up to geosynchronous orbit
00:14:32.717 using electric propulsion
00:14:34.679 that might take you know, a hundred days
00:14:36.838 or 150 days depending on howmuch mass you're carrying.
00:14:40.275 And then, and reserveyour chemical propulsion
00:14:43.171 so that you can change orbits quickly
00:14:44.994 in geosynchronous orbit.
00:14:46.834 Or you can use thechemical propulsion first
00:14:49.412 to quickly get up to geosynchronous
00:14:51.136 and then use your electrical propulsion
00:14:53.089 to slowly change yourgeosynchronous orbit.
00:14:55.797 Blue Ring has a coupleof interesting features.
00:14:59.276 It provides a lot of services
00:15:04.050 to these payloads.
00:15:05.382 So the payload, it couldbe one large payload,
00:15:07.433 or it can be a number of small payloads,
00:15:10.312 and it provides thermal management,
00:15:12.336 it provides electricpower, it provides compute,
00:15:16.695 provides communications.
00:15:19.035 And so when you designa payload for Blue Ring,
00:15:23.115 you don't have,
00:15:24.253 you don't have to figureout all of those things
00:15:27.237 on your own.
00:15:28.236 So kind of radiation tolerant compute
00:15:30.917 is a complicated thing to do.
00:15:32.974 And so we have an unusually large amount
00:15:36.438 of radiation tolerantcompute on board Blue Ring,
00:15:39.033 and you can, yourpayload can just use that
00:15:41.639 when it needs to.
00:15:42.690 So it's sort of all these services,
00:15:46.734 it's you know, it's like a set of APIs.
00:15:49.650 It's a little bit likeAmazon web services,
00:15:51.676 but for space payloadsthat need to move about
00:15:55.055 an earth vicinity or lunar vicinity.
00:15:57.795 AWSS space.
00:15:59.922 Okay, so computing space.
00:16:02.932 So you get a giant chemical rocket
00:16:04.836 to get a payload out to orbit,
00:16:08.035 and then you have theseadmins that show up,
00:16:11.129 this Blue Ring thing thatmanages various things
00:16:13.810 like compute.
00:16:14.643 Exactly.
00:16:15.476 And it can also provide transportation
00:16:16.893 and move you around to different orbits.
00:16:19.012 Including humans, you think?
00:16:20.195 No, but Blue Ring is notdesigned to move humans around.
00:16:23.726 It's designed to move payloads around.
00:16:26.854 Okay.
00:16:27.687 So we're also building a lunar lander,
00:16:29.749 which is of course designed to land humans
00:16:33.640 on the surface of the moon.
00:16:34.917 I'm gonna ask you about that,
00:16:36.578 but let me ask you to juststep back to the old days.
00:16:40.595 You were at Princeton
00:16:42.476 with aspirations to bea theoretical physicist.
00:16:45.386 Yeah.
00:16:47.533 What attracted you to physics
00:16:49.368 and why did you change your mind
00:16:51.798 and not become, why you're not Jeff Bezos,
00:16:54.808 the famous theoretical physicist?
00:16:57.116 So I loved physics and I studied physics
00:16:59.969 and computer science,
00:17:01.638 and I was proceedingalong the physics path.
00:17:05.114 I was planning to major in physics
00:17:06.531 and I wanted to be atheoretical physicist.
00:17:08.907 And the computer science
00:17:10.374 was sort of something I was doing for fun.
00:17:12.655 I really loved it.
00:17:14.577 And I was very good at the programming
00:17:17.867 and doing those things.
00:17:19.674 And I enjoyed all my computerscience classes immensely,
00:17:23.035 but I really was determinedto be a theoretical physicist.
00:17:26.355 It's why I went to Princetonin the first place.
00:17:29.014 It was definitely, and then I realized
00:17:32.596 I was gonna be a mediocretheoretical physicist.
00:17:35.510 And there were a few people in my classes,
00:17:39.115 like in quantum mechanics and so on,
00:17:42.049 who they could effortlessly do things
00:17:44.493 that were so difficult for me.
00:17:46.470 And I realized like you know,there are a thousand ways
00:17:49.575 to be smart and to be a really, you know,
00:17:52.455 theoretical physics isnot one of those fields
00:17:56.013 where only the top few percent
00:17:59.877 actually move the stateof the art forward.
00:18:02.372 It's one of those thingswhere you have to be
00:18:05.011 really just, your brain hasto be wired in a certain way.
00:18:09.214 And there was a guy named,
00:18:10.932 one of these people who convinced me.
00:18:14.519 He didn't mean to convince me,
00:18:16.142 but just by observing him, he convinced me
00:18:17.915 that I should not try tobe a theoretical physicist.
00:18:20.835 His name was Yosanta.
00:18:22.519 And Yosanta was from Sri Lanka.
00:18:26.887 And he was one of the mostbrilliant people I'd ever met.
00:18:30.608 My friend Joe and I wereworking on a very difficult
00:18:34.936 partial differential equationsproblem set one night.
00:18:37.899 And there was one problem thatwe worked on for three hours,
00:18:41.890 and we made no headway whatsoever.
00:18:45.594 And we looked up at eachother at the same time
00:18:48.333 and we said, Yosanta.
00:18:49.628 So we went to Yosanta's dorm room.
00:18:51.875 And he was there, hewas almost always there.
00:18:54.848 And we said Yosanta, we'rehaving trouble solving
00:18:57.558 this partial differential equation,
00:19:00.655 would you mind taking a look?
00:19:02.599 And he said of course.
00:19:03.528 By the way, he was the mosthumble, most kind person.
00:19:07.716 And so he took our,
00:19:08.854 he looked at our problemand he stared at it
00:19:11.913 for just a few seconds, maybe 10 seconds.
00:19:13.730 And he said cosine.
00:19:15.797 And I said, what do you mean Yosanta?
00:19:17.892 What do you mean cosine?
00:19:18.888 He said that's the answer.
00:19:19.767 And I said no, no, no, come on.
00:19:21.596 And he said let me show you.
00:19:22.838 And he took out some paper
00:19:24.133 and he wrote down threepages of equations,
00:19:27.651 everything canceled out.
00:19:29.428 And the answer was cosine.
00:19:30.919 And I said Yosanta, didyou do that in your head?
00:19:35.714 And he said oh no, thatwould be impossible.
00:19:38.152 A few years ago I solved a similar problem
00:19:40.954 and I could map thisproblem onto that problem.
00:19:43.777 And then it was immediately obvious
00:19:45.397 that the answer was cosine.
00:19:47.434 I had a few, you know, youhave an experience like that,
00:19:50.389 you realize maybe beinga theoretical physicist
00:19:54.277 isn't what your,
00:19:55.555 isn't what the universe wants you to be.
00:19:59.351 And so I switched to computerscience and you know,
00:20:04.253 that worked out really well for me.
00:20:05.755 I enjoy it.
00:20:06.588 I still enjoy it today.
00:20:07.523 Yeah, there's a particularkind of intuition you need
00:20:09.638 to be a great physicist,applied to physics.
00:20:12.657 I think the mathematicalskill required today is so high.
00:20:17.529 You have to be a world-class mathematician
00:20:20.929 to be a successfultheoretical physicist today.
00:20:24.313 And it's not you know,
00:20:26.871 you probably need other skills too,
00:20:29.971 intuition, lateral thinking, and so on.
00:20:32.722 But without just top-notch math skills,
00:20:37.127 you're unlikely to be successful.
00:20:39.319 And visualization skill,
00:20:40.847 you have to be able to really kind of do
00:20:43.589 these kinds of thought experiments.
00:20:45.333 And if you want truly great creativity,
00:20:46.918 actually Walter Isaacson writes about you.
00:20:49.571 It puts you on the same level as Einstein.
00:20:52.530 Well, that's very kind.
00:20:56.407 I'm an inventor.
00:20:57.587 If you wanna boil down what I am,
00:21:00.833 I'm really an inventor.
00:21:02.493 And I look at things
00:21:03.900 and I can come up with atypicalsolutions and you know,
00:21:08.756 and then I can create ahundred such atypical solutions
00:21:11.815 for something.
00:21:13.458 99 of them may not survive,you know, scrutiny.
00:21:18.657 But one of those 100 islike hmm, maybe there is,
00:21:21.957 maybe that might work.
00:21:23.570 And then you can keep going from there.
00:21:25.417 So that kind of lateral thinking,
00:21:27.695 that kind of inventiveness
00:21:29.811 in a high dimensionalityspace where the search space
00:21:33.811 is very large, that's wheremy inventive skills come.
00:21:37.489 That's the thing is I self-identify
00:21:40.640 as an inventor more than anything else.
00:21:43.354 Yeah, and he describes inall kinds of different ways,
00:21:45.991 Walter Isaacson does that creativity
00:21:50.448 combined with childlikewander that you've maintained
00:21:54.436 still to this day, all ofthat combined together.
00:21:57.274 Is there, like if you were to study
00:21:59.297 your own brain introspect,how do you think,
00:22:02.171 what's your thinking process like?
00:22:03.654 We'll talk about the writing process
00:22:05.716 of putting it down on paper,
00:22:07.514 which is quite rigorousand famous at Amazon.
00:22:12.874 But how do you, when yousit down, maybe alone,
00:22:15.829 maybe with others,
00:22:17.059 and thinking through thishigh dimensional space
00:22:19.573 and looking for creativesolutions, creative paths forward,
00:22:24.053 is there something you couldsay about that process?
00:22:26.314 It's such a good question,
00:22:27.994 and I honestly don't know how it works.
00:22:31.091 If I did, I would try to explain it.
00:22:32.931 I know it involves lots of wandering.
00:22:35.426 Yeah.
00:22:37.294 So I, you know, when I sitdown to work on a problem,
00:22:40.307 I know I don't know where I'm going.
00:22:43.592 So to go in a straightline, to be efficient,
00:22:47.273 efficiency and inventionare sort of at odds
00:22:50.693 because invention, real invention,
00:22:53.298 not incremental improvement.
00:22:54.633 Incremental improvement is so important
00:22:56.584 in every endeavor, in everything you do.
00:22:58.687 You have to work hard onalso just making things
00:23:00.346 a little bit better.
00:23:02.337 But I'm talking about real invention,
00:23:04.775 real lateral thinking,that requires wandering.
00:23:08.693 And you have to give yourselfpermission to wander.
00:23:11.294 I think a lot of people,
00:23:15.398 they feel like wandering is inefficient.
00:23:20.233 And you know, like whenI sit down at a meeting,
00:23:26.250 I don't know how longthe meeting is gonna take
00:23:28.598 if we're trying to solve a problem.
00:23:30.356 Because if I did, then I'd already,
00:23:33.991 I'd know there's somekind of straight line
00:23:35.689 that we're drawing to the solution.
00:23:38.014 The reality is we may haveto wander for a long time.
00:23:42.270 And I do like group invention.
00:23:43.836 I think there's certainly nothing more fun
00:23:46.919 than sitting at awhiteboard with you know,
00:23:49.635 a group of smart people and spit balling
00:23:53.673 and coming up with new ideasand objections to those ideas,
00:23:57.571 and then solutions to the objections
00:24:00.015 and going back and forth.
00:24:02.076 So like you know, sometimesyou wake up with an idea
00:24:06.217 in the middle of the night
00:24:08.531 and sometimes you sit downwith a group of people
00:24:10.871 and go back and forth
00:24:12.316 and both things are really pleasurable.
00:24:14.754 And when you wander,
00:24:16.031 I think one key thingis to notice a good idea
00:24:21.958 and to maybe, to noticethe kernel of a good idea.
00:24:25.832 Maybe pull at that string.
00:24:28.076 Because I don't think a goodidea has come fully formed.
00:24:31.414 A hundred percent right.
00:24:33.411 In fact, when I come up withwhat I think is a good idea
00:24:37.515 and it survives kind of thefirst level of scrutiny,
00:24:40.975 you know, that I do in my own head
00:24:42.635 and I'm ready to tellsomebody else about the idea,
00:24:45.855 I will often say look,
00:24:47.297 it is going to be really easyfor you to find objections
00:24:50.292 to this idea, but work with me.
00:24:53.154 There's something there.
00:24:54.531 There's something there.
00:24:55.638 And that is intuition.
00:24:57.653 Yeah.
00:24:58.486 Because it's reallyeasy to kill new ideas
00:25:01.716 in the beginning.
00:25:02.738 'Cause they do have so many,
00:25:04.677 so many easy objections to them.
00:25:07.138 So you need to,
00:25:08.130 you need to kind of forewarn people
00:25:09.932 and say look, I know it'sgonna take a lot of work
00:25:12.496 to get this to a fully formed idea.
00:25:14.853 Let's get started on that.
00:25:16.014 It'll be fun.
00:25:17.373 So you got that ability to say cosine
00:25:19.808 in you somewhere after all.
00:25:22.053 Maybe not on math, but-
00:25:23.333 In a different domain.
00:25:24.179 Yeah.
00:25:25.264 There are a thousand waysto be smart, by the way.
00:25:27.600 Yeah.
00:25:28.433 And that is a really, likewhen I go around, you know,
00:25:31.803 and I meet people, I'm always looking
00:25:33.620 for the way that they're smart.
00:25:35.704 And you find it is,
00:25:37.083 that's one of the things thatmakes the world so interesting
00:25:42.182 and fun is that it is not,
00:25:43.936 it's not like IQ is a single dimension.
00:25:48.800 There are people who aresmart in such unique ways.
00:25:52.975 Yeah, you just gave me a good response
00:25:54.640 to when somebody calls mean idiot on the internet.
00:25:57.308 You know, that's a thousandways to be smart, sir.
00:26:01.123 Well, they might tell you,
00:26:02.947 yeah, but there are a millionto be ways to be dumb.
00:26:04.473 Yeah, right.
00:26:06.347 I feel like that's a Mark Twain quote.
00:26:08.889 Okay.
00:26:10.563 All right, you gave me an amazing tour
00:26:12.322 of Blue Origin RocketFactory and Launch Complex
00:26:14.638 in the historic Cape Canaveral.
00:26:17.024 That's where New Glenn,
00:26:18.766 the big rocket we talkedabout is being built
00:26:22.882 and will launch.
00:26:24.524 Can you explain whatthe New Glenn Rocket is
00:26:26.707 and tell me some interestingtechnical aspects
00:26:28.635 of how it works?
00:26:29.702 Sure.
00:26:31.081 New Glenn is a very large,
00:26:35.141 a heavy lift launch vehicle.
00:26:37.643 It'll take about 45 metric tons to LEO,
00:26:41.440 very, very large class.
00:26:44.302 It's about half the thrust,
00:26:46.664 a little more than half the thrust
00:26:48.145 of the Saturn V Rocket.
00:26:50.576 So it's about 3.9 millionpounds of thrust on liftoff.
00:26:55.360 The booster has seven BE-4 engines.
00:26:59.941 Each engine generates a little more
00:27:02.141 than 550,000 pounds of thrust.
00:27:05.507 The engines are fueledby liquid natural gas,
00:27:09.359 liquified natural gas, LNG as the fuel
00:27:12.475 and LOX as the oxidizer.
00:27:15.257 The cycle is an ox-richedstage combustion cycle.
00:27:19.283 It's a cycle that was reallypioneered by the Russians.
00:27:21.858 It's a very good cycle.
00:27:23.642 And that engine is also goingto power the first stage
00:27:29.501 of the Vulcan rocket,
00:27:30.738 which is the UnitedLaunch Alliance rocket.
00:27:33.302 Then the second stage of New Glenn
00:27:36.452 is powered by two BE-3U engines,
00:27:39.307 which is a upper stage variant
00:27:41.620 of our New Shephardliquid hydrogen engine.
00:27:44.424 So the BE-3U has 160,000 pounds of thrust.
00:27:47.826 So two of those 320,000 pounds of thrust
00:27:51.920 and hydrogen is a very good propellant
00:27:54.985 for upper stages becauseit has very high ISP.
00:27:59.122 It's not a great propellantin my view for booster stages
00:28:03.920 because the stages thenget physically so large.
00:28:06.901 Hydrogen has very high ISP,
00:28:10.163 but liquid hydrogen is very,
00:28:12.767 is not dense at all.
00:28:14.825 So to store liquid hydrogen, you know,
00:28:17.377 if you need to store many thousands
00:28:19.074 of pounds of liquid hydrogen,
00:28:20.081 your tanks, your liquidhydrogen tank, it's very large.
00:28:23.099 So you really, you get morebenefit from the higher ISP,
00:28:27.252 the specific impulse.
00:28:29.064 You get more benefit fromthe higher specific impulse
00:28:31.719 on the second stage.
00:28:33.906 And that stage carries less propellant.
00:28:37.563 So you don't get suchgeometrically gigantic tanks.
00:28:41.040 The Delta IV is an example of a vehicle
00:28:44.064 that is all hydrogen.
00:28:45.266 The booster stage is also hydrogen.
00:28:47.582 And I think that it's avery effective vehicle,
00:28:49.985 but it never was very cost effective.
00:28:52.801 So it's operationally very capable
00:28:55.400 but not very cost effective.
00:28:56.899 So size is also costly.
00:28:58.559 Size is costly.
00:28:59.761 So it's interesting.
00:29:01.503 Rockets love to be big.
00:29:03.578 Everything works better.
00:29:05.199 What do you mean by that?
00:29:06.361 You've told me that before.
00:29:07.478 It sounds epic, but what does it mean?
00:29:10.054 I mean, when you look at the,
00:29:12.239 kind of the physics of rocket engines
00:29:15.922 and also when you look at parasitic mass,
00:29:19.742 it doesn't, if you have,
00:29:20.862 let's say you have an avionic system,
00:29:22.499 so you have a guidance and control system,
00:29:25.059 that is gonna be aboutthe same mass and size
00:29:29.506 for a giant rocket as it isgonna be for a tiny rocket.
00:29:33.555 And so that's just parasitic mass
00:29:37.119 that is very consequentialif you're building
00:29:40.083 a very small rocket,
00:29:41.206 but is trivial if you'rebuilding a very large rocket.
00:29:44.098 So you have the parasitic mass thing.
00:29:46.323 And then if you look at, for example,
00:29:48.099 rocket engines have turbo pumps.
00:29:50.559 They have to pressurizethe fuel and the oxidizer
00:29:53.800 up to a very high pressure level
00:29:55.779 in order to inject itinto the thrust chamber
00:29:58.101 where it burns.
00:29:59.927 And those pumps, allrotating machines, in fact
00:30:03.523 get more efficient as they get larger.
00:30:06.765 So really tiny turbo pumps
00:30:09.668 are very challenging to manufacture.
00:30:13.110 And any kind of gaps, you know,
00:30:15.648 are like between the housing for example,
00:30:19.320 and the rotating impellerthat pressurizes the fuel,
00:30:22.729 there has to be some gap there.
00:30:24.502 You can't have those partsscraping against one another.
00:30:27.406 And those gaps drive inefficiencies.
00:30:31.146 And so, you know, if youhave a very large turbo pump,
00:30:34.972 those gaps in percentageterms end up being very small.
00:30:39.772 And so there's a bunch of things
00:30:42.247 that you end up lovingabout having a large rocket
00:30:46.182 and that you end uphating for a small rocket.
00:30:48.525 But there's a giantexception to this rule,
00:30:51.483 and it is manufacturing.
00:30:53.298 So manufacturing large structuresis very, very challenging.
00:30:58.227 It's a pain in the butt.
00:30:59.509 And so, you know, it's just if you have,
00:31:01.628 if you're making a small rocket engine,
00:31:03.483 you can move all the pieces by hand,
00:31:04.979 you could assemble it on atable, one person can do it,
00:31:08.327 you know, you don't need cranesand heavy lift operations
00:31:12.659 and tooling, and so on and so on.
00:31:14.968 When you start building bigobjects, infrastructure,
00:31:19.005 civil infrastructure,just like the launchpad
00:31:22.424 and the you know, all this,
00:31:23.623 we went and visited,
00:31:25.371 I took you to the launchpad
00:31:26.468 and you can see it's so monumental.
00:31:28.424 Yeah, it is.
00:31:29.428 And so just these thingsbecome major undertakings,
00:31:33.100 both from an engineering point of view,
00:31:35.187 but also from a constructionand cost point of view.
00:31:37.747 And even the foundationof the launchpad,
00:31:39.987 I mean, this is Florida,
00:31:42.205 like isn't like swamp land?
00:31:43.209 Like how deep do you have to go?
00:31:44.550 You have to at Cape Canaveral,
00:31:46.502 in fact, at most ocean,you know, most launch pads
00:31:48.969 are on beaches somewhere in the oceanside.
00:31:52.468 'cause you wanna launch overwater for safety reasons.
00:31:57.245 The yes, you have to drive pilings,
00:32:01.449 you know, dozens and dozensand dozens of pilings,
00:32:04.806 you know, 50, a 100, 150 feet deep
00:32:07.944 to get enough structural integrity
00:32:09.481 for these very large, you know, it's yes,
00:32:11.408 these turn into majorcivil engineering projects.
00:32:15.134 I just have to sayeverything about that factory
00:32:17.587 is pretty badass.
00:32:18.748 You said tooling, the bigger it gets,
00:32:21.511 the more epic it is.
00:32:22.521 It does make it epic.
00:32:23.703 Yeah.
00:32:24.536 It's fun to look at.
00:32:25.369 It's extraordinary.
00:32:26.353 It's humbling also,
00:32:27.577 'cause you know, humans areso small compared to it.
00:32:29.678 We are building these enormous machines
00:32:33.428 that are harnessing enormous amounts
00:32:35.785 of chemical power, you know,in very, very compact packages.
00:32:43.165 It's truly extraordinary.
00:32:44.429 But then there's allthe different components
00:32:46.605 and that you know, the materials involved.
00:32:50.025 Is there something interesting
00:32:51.546 that you can describe about the materials
00:32:54.768 that's comprised the rockets?
00:32:57.148 So it has to be as lightas possible, I guess,
00:33:00.009 whilst withstanding the heatand the harsh conditions?
00:33:03.144 Yeah, I play a littlekind of game sometimes
00:33:06.528 with other rocket peoplethat I run into where
00:33:09.530 say what are the things
00:33:10.824 that would amaze the 1960s engineers?
00:33:13.472 Like what's changed?
00:33:15.843 'Cause surprisingly, someof rocketry greatest hits
00:33:18.441 have not changed.
00:33:19.967 They are still,
00:33:20.971 they would recognize immediatelya lot of what we do today.
00:33:24.489 And it's exactly what theypioneered back in the '60s.
00:33:27.966 But a few things have changed.
00:33:30.533 You know, the use of carbon composites
00:33:34.572 is very different today.
00:33:36.483 You know, we can build very sophisticated,
00:33:39.898 you saw our carbon tape laying machine
00:33:42.841 that builds the giant fairings.
00:33:44.886 And we can build these incredibly light,
00:33:48.707 very stiff fairing structures
00:33:52.006 out of carbon composite material
00:33:55.488 that they could not have dreamed of.
00:33:57.666 I mean the efficiency,the structural efficiency
00:34:00.963 of that material is so highcompared to any you know,
00:34:05.304 metallic material youmight use or anything else.
00:34:07.943 So that's one.
00:34:12.221 Aluminum lithium and the ability
00:34:15.289 to friction stir weld aluminum lithium.
00:34:18.150 Do you remember the frictionstir welding that I showed you?
00:34:20.228 Yes, incredible.
00:34:21.587 This is a remarkable technology.
00:34:23.344 This was invented decades ago,
00:34:25.442 but has become very practical
00:34:26.605 over just the last couple of decades.
00:34:29.199 And instead of usingheat to weld two pieces
00:34:32.995 of metal together, itliterally stirs the two pieces.
00:34:37.388 There's a pin thatrotates at a certain rate
00:34:40.824 and you put that pin betweenthe two plates of metal
00:34:44.331 that you wanna weld together.
00:34:46.148 And then you move it ata very precise speed.
00:34:50.362 And instead of heating the material,
00:34:52.762 it heats it a littlebit because of friction,
00:34:54.742 but not very much.
00:34:56.054 You can literallyimmediately after welding
00:34:57.806 with stir friction welding,
00:34:58.965 you can touch the materialand it's just barely warm.
00:35:01.943 It literally stirs the molecules together.
00:35:05.066 It's quite extraordinary.
00:35:06.044 Relatively low temperature.
00:35:07.850 And I guess high temperatureis what makes them,
00:35:09.850 that makes it a weak point?
00:35:11.186 Exactly.
00:35:12.019 So with traditional weldingtechniques, you may have
00:35:16.607 whatever the underlyingstrength characteristics
00:35:19.666 of the material are,
00:35:21.407 you end up with weakregions where you weld.
00:35:24.263 And with friction stir welding,
00:35:26.524 the welds are just asstrong as the bulk material.
00:35:29.830 So it really allows you,
00:35:31.549 and so, 'cause when you're,
00:35:32.902 you know, let's say you're building a tank
00:35:34.765 that you're gonna pressurize
00:35:36.187 you know, a large liquid natural gas tank
00:35:38.436 for our booster stage, for example.
00:35:41.288 You know, if you are weldingthat with traditional methods,
00:35:44.186 you have to size those weld lands,
00:35:46.288 the thickness of those pieces
00:35:48.151 with that knockdown forwhatever damage you're doing
00:35:50.578 with the weld.
00:35:51.411 And that's gonna add a lotof weight to that tank.
00:35:53.895 I mean, even just thelooking at the fairings,
00:35:56.473 the result of that,
00:35:58.085 the complex shape that it takes and-
00:36:01.671 Yeah.
00:36:02.504 And like what it's supposedto do is kind of incredible
00:36:05.184 'cause so people don't knowit's on top of the rocket,
00:36:06.947 it's gonna fall apart.
00:36:08.584 That's its task.
00:36:09.749 But it has to stay strong sometimes.
00:36:11.986 Yes.
00:36:13.379 And then disappear when it needs to.
00:36:14.999 That's right.
00:36:15.997 Which is a very difficult task.
00:36:17.352 Yes.
00:36:18.401 When you need something thatneeds to have 100% integrity
00:36:22.186 until it needs to have 0% integrity.
00:36:24.926 It needs to stay attacheduntil it's ready to go away.
00:36:27.693 And then when it goes away,it has to go away completely.
00:36:31.032 You use explosive charges for that.
00:36:33.784 And so it's a very robust way
00:36:36.198 of separating structure
00:36:38.950 when you need to.
00:36:40.390 Exploding
00:36:41.475 Yeah.
00:36:42.308 Little tiny bits of explosive material
00:36:45.099 and it just, it'll severthe whole connection.
00:36:49.945 So if you wanna go from100% structural integrity
00:36:54.688 to zero as fast aspossible use explosives,
00:36:58.065 Use explosives.
00:36:59.831 The entirety of this thing is so badass.
00:37:02.106 Okay, so we're back to the two stages.
00:37:04.185 So the first stage is reusable.
00:37:06.091 Yeah.
00:37:06.924 Second stage is expendable.
00:37:09.009 Second stage is liquidhydrogen, liquid oxygen.
00:37:11.929 So we could take advantage ofthe higher specific impulse.
00:37:14.709 The the first stage landsdownrange on a landing platform
00:37:20.302 in the ocean, comes back for maintenance
00:37:24.572 and get ready to do the next mission.
00:37:26.969 I mean there's a million questions,
00:37:29.668 but also is there apath towards reusability
00:37:31.303 for the second stage?
00:37:32.754 There is, and we know how to do that.
00:37:35.645 Right now we're gonnawork on manufacturing
00:37:39.103 that second stage to make itas inexpensive as possible.
00:37:42.736 Sort of two paths for a second stage,
00:37:45.633 make it reusable,
00:37:47.217 or work really hard to make it inexpensive
00:37:50.799 so you can afford to expend it.
00:37:53.778 And that trade is actually notobvious which one is better.
00:38:00.746 Even in terms of cost.
00:38:02.200 Even like time cost?
00:38:03.239 I'm talking about cost is, you know,
00:38:05.578 space flight, getting intoorbit is a solved problem.
00:38:08.498 We solved it back in youknow, the '50s and '60s.
00:38:11.801 You're making it sound easy.
00:38:13.299 So the only thing that,
00:38:14.541 the only interesting problem
00:38:15.872 is dramatically reducingthe cost of access to orbit,
00:38:19.917 which is if you can do that,
00:38:21.618 you open up a bunch ofnew, you know, endeavors
00:38:26.918 that lots of startup companies,everybody else can do.
00:38:29.786 So that's, we really,
00:38:30.895 that's one of our missions
00:38:32.815 is to you know, be part of this industry
00:38:36.175 and lower the cost toorbit so that there can be
00:38:40.078 you know, a kind of arenaissance, a golden age
00:38:43.499 of people doing all kinds ofinteresting things in space.
00:38:47.335 I like how you said gettingto orbit is a solved problem.
00:38:50.556 It is just the only interestingthing is reducing the cost.
00:38:53.539 You know, how you candescribe every single problem
00:38:55.722 facing human civilization that way.
00:38:57.179 The physicist would sayeverything is a solved problem.
00:39:00.714 We've solved everything.
00:39:01.881 The rest is just well,Rutherford said that
00:39:04.842 "it's just stamp collecting."
00:39:06.380 It's just the details.
00:39:07.616 It's some of the greatestinnovations and inventions
00:39:10.461 and you know, brilliance isin that cost reduction stage.
00:39:14.817 Right, and you, you've had along career of cost reduction.
00:39:18.071 For sure.
00:39:18.904 And when you,
00:39:20.074 what does cost reduction really mean?
00:39:22.734 It means inventing a better way.
00:39:24.997 Yeah, exactly.
00:39:25.995 Right, and when you invent a better way,
00:39:27.498 you make the whole world richer.
00:39:29.019 So, you know, whatever it was,
00:39:30.378 I don't know how manythousands of years ago,
00:39:32.021 somebody invented the plow.
00:39:34.333 And when they invented the plow,
00:39:35.962 they made the whole world richer
00:39:37.437 because they made farming less expensive.
00:39:40.258 And so it is a big dealto invent better ways.
00:39:45.876 That's how the world gets richer.
00:39:48.533 So what are some ofthe biggest challenges
00:39:52.516 on the manufacturing sideand the engineering side
00:39:54.521 that you're facing in working
00:39:56.703 to get to the first launch of New Glenn?
00:40:01.376 The first launch is one thing
00:40:03.199 and we'll do that in 2024coming up in this coming year.
00:40:07.141 The real thing that's the bigger challenge
00:40:09.962 is making sure that our factory
00:40:12.873 is efficiently manufacturing at rate.
00:40:18.296 So rate production.
00:40:19.958 So consider if you wanna launch New Glenn
00:40:23.459 you know, 24 times a year.
00:40:25.992 You need to manufacture a upper stage
00:40:30.117 since they're expendableevery, you know, twice a month,
00:40:34.877 you need to do one every two weeks.
00:40:36.357 So you need to be,
00:40:37.356 you need to have all of yourmanufacturing facilities
00:40:41.036 and processes and inspection techniques
00:40:43.616 and acceptance tests andeverything operating at rate.
00:40:47.822 And rate manufacturingis at least as difficult
00:40:51.617 as designing the vehiclein the first place.
00:40:55.357 And the same thing.
00:40:56.236 So every upper stagehas two BE-3U engines.
00:41:03.275 So those engines you know, you need
00:41:05.453 if you're gonna launch thisthe vehicle twice a month,
00:41:08.859 you need four engines a month.
00:41:10.357 So you need an engine every week.
00:41:11.675 So you need to be,
00:41:12.998 that engine needs to bebeing produced at rate.
00:41:16.638 And that's a,
00:41:17.656 and there's all of the thingsthat you need to do that,
00:41:20.719 all the right machine tools,all the right fixtures,
00:41:24.138 the right people, process, et cetera.
00:41:26.977 So it's one thing to builda first article, right.
00:41:30.796 So that's you know, to launchNew Glenn for the first time,
00:41:35.076 you need to produce a first article.
00:41:37.492 But that's not the hard part.
00:41:39.899 The hard part iseverything that's going on
00:41:42.551 behind the scenes to build a factory
00:41:45.500 that can produce New Glenn's at rate.
00:41:47.741 So the first one is produced in a way
00:41:49.518 that enables the productionof the second and third
00:41:52.199 and the fourth and thefifth and sixth, and so on.
00:41:54.336 You could think of the first article
00:41:56.437 as kind of pushing,
00:41:57.557 it pushes all of the ratemanufacturing technology along.
00:42:02.598 You know, in otherwords, it's kind of the,
00:42:05.660 it's the test article in a way
00:42:09.177 that's testing out yourmanufacturing technologies.
00:42:13.224 The manufacturing is the big challenge.
00:42:15.672 Yes.
00:42:16.505 I mean I don't want to make itsound like any of it is easy.
00:42:18.682 I mean the people whoare designing the engines
00:42:21.909 and all this, all of it is hard for sure.
00:42:25.235 But the challenge rightnow is driving really hard
00:42:29.961 to get to rate manufacturing
00:42:32.399 and to do that in an efficient way.
00:42:34.059 Again, kind of back to our cost point.
00:42:36.812 If you get to rate manufacturingin an inefficient way,
00:42:39.957 you haven't really solved the cost problem
00:42:41.855 and maybe you haven't really moved
00:42:43.914 this state of the art forward.
00:42:45.274 All this has to be
00:42:46.298 about moving the state-of-the art forward.
00:42:48.177 There are easier businesses to do.
00:42:50.040 I always tell people look, ifyou are trying to make money,
00:42:53.239 you know, like start asalty snack food company
00:42:55.596 or something, you know.
00:42:57.417 I'm gonna write that idea down.
00:43:01.308 Like make the Lex Fridman potato chips,
00:43:03.758 you know, this is-
00:43:04.762 Don't say it, people are gonna steal it.
00:43:08.847 But yeah, it's hard.
00:43:10.067 You see what I'm saying?
00:43:11.457 It's like there's nothingeasy about this business
00:43:14.121 but it's its own reward.
00:43:17.196 It's fascinating, it'sworthwhile, it's meaningful.
00:43:22.176 And so you know, not,
00:43:23.274 I don't wanna pick onsalty snack food companies,
00:43:25.439 but I think it's less meaningful.
00:43:26.757 You know, at the end of the day,
00:43:29.088 you're not gonna haveaccomplished something amazing.
00:43:33.398 Yeah, there's-
00:43:34.271 Even if you do make alot of money out of it.
00:43:35.778 Yeah, there's somethingfundamentally different
00:43:37.995 about the quote unquotebusiness of space exploration.
00:43:41.454 Yeah, for sure.
00:43:42.459 It's a grand project of humanity.
00:43:44.231 Yes.
00:43:45.064 It's one of humanity's grand challenges.
00:43:47.637 And especially as youlook at going to the moon
00:43:51.040 and going to Mars and buildinggiant O'Neill colonies
00:43:54.418 and unlocking all the things.
00:43:56.336 You know, I won't live long enough
00:43:58.522 to see the fruits of this,
00:44:01.274 but the fruits of this comefrom building a road to space,
00:44:06.840 getting the infrastructure.
00:44:08.959 I'll give you an analogy.
00:44:10.440 When I started Amazon,
00:44:12.618 I didn't have to develop a payment system.
00:44:15.583 It already existed.
00:44:16.575 It was called the credit card.
00:44:18.038 I didn't have to developa transportation system
00:44:21.399 to deliver the packages.
00:44:22.578 It already existed.
00:44:23.582 It was called the postal service
00:44:25.503 and Royal Mail and Deutsche Post.
00:44:28.121 And so all this heavylifting infrastructure
00:44:32.300 was already in place.
00:44:33.960 And I could stand on its shoulders.
00:44:36.731 And that's why when youlook at the internet,
00:44:40.260 you know, by the way, anothergiant piece of infrastructure
00:44:43.556 that was around in the early,
00:44:44.555 I'm taking you back to like 1994,
00:44:46.819 people were using dial up modems.
00:44:49.019 And it was piggybacking
00:44:50.714 on top of the long distance phone network.
00:44:53.534 That's how the internet,
00:44:55.196 that's you know, how peoplewere accessing servers
00:44:57.199 and so on.
00:44:58.638 And that again, if that hadn't existed,
00:45:02.179 it would've been hundredsof billions of CapEx
00:45:05.377 to put that out there.
00:45:06.521 No startup company could have done that.
00:45:09.176 And so the problem you know, you see in,
00:45:13.432 if you look at the dynamismin the internet space
00:45:16.776 over the last 20 years,
00:45:18.578 it's because you know, you seelike two kids in a dorm room
00:45:22.520 could start an internet companythat could be successful
00:45:24.796 and do amazing things.
00:45:26.415 Beause they didn't have tobuild heavy infrastructure.
00:45:28.760 It was already there.
00:45:30.397 And that's what I wanna do.
00:45:33.317 I take you know, my Amazon winnings
00:45:36.858 and use that to build heavy infrastructure
00:45:38.942 so that the next generation you know,
00:45:41.834 the generation that's mychildren and their children,
00:45:45.276 these, you know, those generations
00:45:47.882 can then use that heavy infrastructure.
00:45:50.234 Then there'll be space entrepreneurs
00:45:51.899 who start in their dorm room.
00:45:53.356 Yeah.
00:45:54.235 Like that will be a marker of success.
00:45:56.636 When you can have a reallyvaluable space company
00:46:00.177 started in a dorm room,
00:46:01.831 then we know that we'vebuilt enough infrastructure
00:46:04.223 so that ingenuity and imaginationcan really be unleashed.
00:46:09.018 I find that very exciting.
00:46:10.734 As they will of course, as kids do,
00:46:13.418 take all of this hardinfrastructurability for granted.
00:46:15.978 Of course.
00:46:17.477 Which is-
00:46:18.310 That's the entrepreneurial spirit.
00:46:19.479 That's an inventors greatest dream.
00:46:23.501 Yeah.
00:46:24.334 Is that their inventionsare so successful
00:46:26.717 that they are one day taken for granted.
00:46:29.109 You know, nobody thinks ofAmazon as an invention anymore.
00:46:31.859 Nobody thinks of customer reviews as,
00:46:33.979 we pioneered customer reviews,
00:46:35.419 but now they're so commonplace.
00:46:37.312 Same thing with oneclick shopping and so on.
00:46:39.500 But that's a compliment.
00:46:40.655 That's how you know,
00:46:41.857 you invent something that's so used,
00:46:45.560 so beneficially used by so many people
00:46:48.219 that they take it for granted.
00:46:49.879 I don't know about nobody.
00:46:50.895 That's every time I use Amazon,
00:46:52.097 I'm still amazed how does this work?
00:46:53.594 Logistics.
00:46:54.724 Well, that proves you'revery curious explorer.
00:46:57.777 All right, all right, back to rockets.
00:46:59.997 Timeline.
00:47:01.911 You said 2024.
00:47:04.480 As it stands now,
00:47:06.394 are both the first testlaunch and the launch
00:47:09.029 of escapade explorersto Mars still possible?
00:47:11.659 In 2024?- In 2024.
00:47:13.154 Yeah.
00:47:13.987 Yeah, I think so.
00:47:14.965 For sure the first launch,
00:47:16.318 and then we'll see ifescapade goes on that or not.
00:47:19.479 I think that the first launch for sure.
00:47:21.157 And I hope escapade too.
00:47:23.265 Hope.
00:47:24.640 Well, I just don't know which mission
00:47:26.378 it's actually gonna be slated on.
00:47:28.279 So we also have other things
00:47:30.195 that might go on that first mission.
00:47:31.617 Oh, I got it.
00:47:32.510 But you're optimistic thatthe launches will still-
00:47:35.181 Oh, the first launch,
00:47:36.351 I'm very optimistic that the first launch
00:47:37.834 of New Glenn will be in 2024.
00:47:39.599 And I'm just not a hundred percent certain
00:47:43.036 what payload will be on that first launch.
00:47:44.638 Are you nervous about it?
00:47:46.136 Are you kidding?
00:47:47.140 I'm extremely nervous about it.
00:47:51.120 Oh man.
00:47:52.178 A hundred percent.
00:47:53.798 I've, you know, every launch I go to,
00:47:56.993 you know, for New Shephard,for other vehicles too,
00:47:59.878 I'm always nervous for these launches.
00:48:02.041 But yes, for sure.
00:48:03.040 A first launch to haveno nervousness about that
00:48:06.076 would be, you know, somesign of derangement,
00:48:08.398 I think so.
00:48:09.774 Well, I got to visit the launchpad,
00:48:11.195 it's pretty, I mean, it's epic.
00:48:14.380 You know, we havedone a tremendous amount
00:48:17.720 of ground testing, a tremendousamount of simulation.
00:48:21.495 So, you know, a lot of the problems
00:48:25.453 that we might find inflight have been resolved,
00:48:28.018 but there are some problemsyou can only find in flight.
00:48:31.095 So, you know, cross your fingers.
00:48:33.455 I guarantee you, you'llhave fun watching it
00:48:36.096 no matter what happens.
00:48:37.341 100% when the thing isfully assembled and comes up.
00:48:40.589 Yeah, the transporter erector.
00:48:44.522 The erector, yeah.
00:48:45.515 Just the transporter erectorfor a rocket of this scale
00:48:48.179 Yeah.- is extraordinary.
00:48:49.659 That's an incredible machine.
00:48:50.820 The vehicle travels out horizontally
00:48:54.477 and then kind of-
00:48:55.580 Yeah.
00:48:56.413 You know, comes up.
00:48:57.458 Over a few hours?
00:48:58.326 Yeah, it's a beautiful thing to watch.
00:49:00.143 Speaking of which, ifthat makes you nervous,
00:49:04.218 I don't know if you remember,
00:49:06.622 but you were aboard a New Shephard
00:49:11.179 on its first crude flight.
00:49:14.499 How was that experience?
00:49:17.837 Were you terrified then?
00:49:20.060 You know, strangely, I wasn't, you know.
00:49:22.096 When you ride the rocket-
00:49:23.619 It's true.
00:49:24.570 less nerve wracking.
00:49:25.586 Its true.
00:49:26.465 I've watched other people ride the rocket
00:49:28.039 and I'm more nervous
00:49:29.076 than when I was inside the rocket myself.
00:49:31.835 It was a difficult conversationto have with my mother
00:49:35.487 when I told her I wasgonna go on the first one.
00:49:38.676 And not only was I gonna go,
00:49:40.058 but I was gonna bring my brother too.
00:49:41.258 This is a tough conversationto have with a mom.
00:49:44.274 There's a long pause when you told her.
00:49:46.917 She's like both of you?
00:49:50.611 And it was an incredible experience
00:49:54.397 and we were laughing inside the capsule
00:49:59.081 and you know, we're not nervous.
00:50:01.438 The people on the groundwere very nervous for us.
00:50:05.671 It was actually one of themost emotionally powerful parts
00:50:12.340 of the experience was nothappened even before the flight
00:50:17.659 at 4:30 in the morning,brother and I are getting ready
00:50:21.697 to go to the launch site
00:50:23.338 and Lauren is gonna takeus there in her helicopter
00:50:25.594 and we're getting ready to leave.
00:50:27.213 And we go outside the ranch house there
00:50:29.180 in west Texas wherethe launch facility is.
00:50:32.576 And all of our family, mykids and my brother's kids
00:50:38.120 and our you know, ourparents, and close friends
00:50:44.587 are assembled there.
00:50:46.601 And they're saying goodbye to us,
00:50:48.383 but they're kind of saying,
00:50:50.461 maybe they think they'resaying goodbye to us forever.
00:50:54.114 And you know, we mightnot have felt that way.
00:50:56.359 But it was obvious from their faces
00:50:57.778 how nervous they werethat they felt that way.
00:51:00.417 And it was sort of powerful
00:51:01.931 because it allowed us to see,
00:51:03.900 it was almost like attendingyour own memorial service
00:51:06.239 or something.
00:51:07.136 Like you could feel how lovedyou were in that moment.
00:51:09.856 And it was really amazing.
00:51:12.718 Yeah, and I mean there'sjust a epic nature to it too.
00:51:18.471 The accent, thefloating and zero gravity.
00:51:21.170 I'll tell you something very interesting.
00:51:22.934 Zero gravity feels very natural.
00:51:25.184 I don't know if it's because we are,
00:51:27.753 you know, it's like returnto the womb or what.
00:51:30.026 You just confirmed you're an alien.
00:51:33.491 But that's okay.
00:51:35.368 I think that's what you just said.
00:51:37.011 It feels so natural to be in zero G.
00:51:38.602 It was really interesting.
00:51:39.735 And then what people talkabout the overview effect
00:51:42.056 and seeing earth from space,
00:51:44.395 I had that feeling very powerfully.
00:51:46.038 I think everyone did.
00:51:49.237 You see how fragile the earth is.
00:51:51.698 If you're not an environmentalist,it will make you one.
00:51:54.554 The the great Jim Lovell quote, you know,
00:51:57.776 he looked back at the earth from space
00:51:59.822 and he said he realized"you don't go to heaven
00:52:02.542 when you die.
00:52:03.415 You go to heaven when you're born."
00:52:05.421 And it's just you know, that's the feeling
00:52:08.379 that people get when they're in space.
00:52:09.856 You see all this blackness,all this nothingness,
00:52:12.236 and there's one gem oflife, and it's earth.
00:52:15.179 It is a gem.
00:52:16.642 What, you know, you've talked a lot
00:52:19.536 about decision making throughoutyour time with Amazon.
00:52:23.196 What was that decisionlike to be the first
00:52:27.402 to ride New Shephard?
00:52:29.001 Like what, just be beforeyou talked to your mom.
00:52:31.178 Yeah.
00:52:32.011 What, like the pros and cons,
00:52:34.352 like actually as one human being,
00:52:37.035 as a leader of a company on all fronts,
00:52:41.214 like what was that decision making like?
00:52:43.254 I decided that, first of all,
00:52:45.677 I knew the vehicle extremely well.
00:52:48.256 I know the team who built it.
00:52:49.678 I know the vehicle.
00:52:53.161 I am very comfortable withlike the escape system.
00:52:57.997 We put as much effort into theescape system on that vehicle
00:53:03.262 as we put into all the restof the vehicle combined.
00:53:05.835 It's one of the hardestpieces of engineering
00:53:08.193 in the entire New Shephard architecture.
00:53:10.361 Can you actually describe,
00:53:11.697 what do you mean by escape system?
00:53:13.401 What's involved?
00:53:14.234 We have a solid rocket motor
00:53:16.341 in the base of the crew capsule
00:53:18.756 so that if anything goes wrong on ascent,
00:53:23.498 you know, while the mainrocket engine is firing,
00:53:26.776 we can ignite this solid rocket motor
00:53:30.314 in the base of the crew capsuleand escape from the booster.
00:53:35.700 It's a very challenging systemto build, design, validate,
00:53:39.915 test, all of these things.
00:53:42.360 It is the reason that I amcomfortable letting anyone
00:53:46.297 go on New Shephard.
00:53:47.493 So the booster is as safe andreliable as we can make it.
00:53:53.315 But we are harnessing,
00:53:56.578 whenever you're talkingabout rocket engines,
00:53:59.077 I don't care what rocketengine you're talking about,
00:54:02.337 you are harnessing such vast power
00:54:06.095 in such a small, compact, geometric space.
00:54:10.222 The power density is soenormous that it is impossible
00:54:15.459 to ever be sure thatnothing will go wrong.
00:54:18.956 And so the only way to improve safety
00:54:23.080 is to have an escape system.
00:54:24.780 And you know, and historically rockets,
00:54:27.256 human rated rocketshave had escape systems.
00:54:29.501 Only the space shuttle did not.
00:54:32.682 And, but Apollo had one,
00:54:35.161 you know, all of the previous,you know, Gemini, et cetera,
00:54:39.758 they all had escape systems.
00:54:42.154 And we have on New shephardof unusual escapes,
00:54:45.999 most escape systems are towers.
00:54:48.457 We have a pusher escape system.
00:54:50.097 So the solid rocket motoris actually embedded
00:54:52.598 in the base of the crew capsule.
00:54:53.912 And it pushes and it's reusable
00:54:55.902 in the sense that if we don't use it,
00:54:58.862 so if we have a nominalmission, we land with it.
00:55:02.096 The tower systems have to be ejected
00:55:04.598 at a certain point in the mission,
00:55:06.421 and so they get wastedeven in a nominal mission.
00:55:09.358 And so again, you know, costreally matters on these things.
00:55:12.318 So we figured out how tohave the escape system
00:55:14.252 be a reusable ,
00:55:16.577 in the event that it'snot used, you can reuse it
00:55:19.176 and have it be a pusher system.
00:55:21.355 It's a very sophisticated thing.
00:55:23.058 So I knew these things.
00:55:24.416 You asked me about my decision to go
00:55:26.779 and so I know the vehicle very well.
00:55:28.700 I know the people who designed it.
00:55:31.434 I had great trust in them
00:55:33.100 and in the engineering that we did.
00:55:35.834 And I thought to myself look,if I am not ready to go,
00:55:41.036 then I wouldn't want anyone to go.
00:55:43.596 A tourism vehicle has tobe designed in my view,
00:55:47.317 to have very, to be assafe as one can make it.
00:55:50.231 You can't make it perfectly safe.
00:55:52.794 It's impossible.
00:55:54.556 But you know, you just have to,
00:55:56.959 people will do things.
00:55:58.080 People take risks, youknow, they climb mountains,
00:56:00.849 they skydive, they do deepunderwater scuba diving,
00:56:05.055 and so on.
00:56:05.888 People are okay taking risk.
00:56:08.177 You can't eliminate the risk.
00:56:10.198 But it is something, becauseit's a tourism vehicle,
00:56:13.660 you have to do your utmostto eliminate those risks.
00:56:16.954 And I felt very good about the system.
00:56:19.102 I think it's one of thereasons I was so calm
00:56:22.340 inside and maybe others weren't just calm,
00:56:24.796 they didn't know asmuch about it as I did.
00:56:26.497 Who was in charge ofengaging the escape system?
00:56:28.241 Did you have-
00:56:29.307 It's automated.
00:56:30.140 Okay.
00:56:30.973 The escape system is-
00:56:31.903 I was visualizing deployment of that.
00:56:33.205 is completely automated.
00:56:34.209 Automated is better becauseit can react so much faster.
00:56:38.569 So yeah, for tourism rockets
00:56:40.647 safety is a huge, huge, hugepriority for space exploration
00:56:43.729 also, but a tiny, you know, a delta less.
00:56:46.725 Yes.
00:56:47.558 I mean I think for youknow, if you're doing,
00:56:49.308 you know, there are human activities
00:56:51.409 where we tolerate more risk.
00:56:52.586 If you're savingsomebody's life, you know,
00:56:54.370 if you are engaging in real exploration,
00:56:59.505 these are things where, you know,
00:57:02.566 I personally think wewould accept more risk
00:57:07.641 in part because you have to.
00:57:09.747 Is there a part of you that's frustrated
00:57:12.902 by the rate of progress in Blue Origin?
00:57:16.083 Blue Origin needs to be much faster.
00:57:18.144 And it's one of thereasons that I left my role
00:57:21.903 as the CEO of Amazona couple of years ago.
00:57:25.664 I needed, I wanted to come in
00:57:27.568 and Blue Origin needs me right now.
00:57:30.072 And so I had always, whenI was the CEO of Amazon,
00:57:33.124 my point of view on this is if I'm the CEO
00:57:35.864 of a publicly traded company
00:57:38.064 it's going to get my full attention.
00:57:39.846 And I really, it's justhow I think about things.
00:57:44.484 It was very important to me.
00:57:46.106 I felt I had an obligationto all the stakeholders
00:57:49.685 at Amazon to do that.
00:57:52.385 And so having, you know, turned the CEO,
00:57:55.363 I'm still the executive chair there,
00:57:57.145 but I've turned the CEO role over.
00:57:59.400 And the reason, theprimary reason I did that
00:58:02.814 is so that I could spendtime on Blue Origin
00:58:06.012 adding some you know, energy,some sense of urgency.
00:58:09.693 We need to move muchfaster and we're going to.
00:58:13.151 What are the ways to speed it up?
00:58:15.148 So, I mean there's,
00:58:18.484 you've talked a lot of differentways to sort of at Amazon,
00:58:23.946 you know, removing barriersfor progress or distributing,
00:58:30.322 making everybodyautonomous and self reliant
00:58:33.026 in terms of all those kinds of things.
00:58:34.645 Is that apply at Blue Origin
00:58:37.286 or is the-
00:58:38.119 It does apply.
00:58:38.952 You know, I'm leading this directly.
00:58:41.507 We are gonna become theworld's most decisive company
00:58:45.187 across any industry.
00:58:47.183 And so you know, at Amazonever since the beginning,
00:58:53.726 I said we are gonna become
00:58:54.776 the world's most customerobsessed company.
00:58:59.102 And no matter the industry, like people,
00:59:01.603 one day people are going to come to Amazon
00:59:03.900 from the healthcareindustry and wanna know
00:59:06.346 how did you guys,
00:59:07.345 how are you so customer obsessed?
00:59:08.446 How do you actually notjust pay lip service,
00:59:10.823 but actually do that?
00:59:13.061 And from you know,
00:59:14.360 all different industriesshould come on and study us
00:59:16.226 to see how we accomplish that.
00:59:19.007 And the analogous thing at Blue Origin
00:59:21.869 and it will help us move faster
00:59:24.289 is we are gonna become theworld's most decisive company.
00:59:28.864 We're gonna get really good
00:59:30.303 at taking appropriate technology risk
00:59:32.863 and making those decisions quickly.
00:59:34.944 You know, being bold on those things.
00:59:37.310 That's what, and having the right culture
00:59:39.609 that supports that.
00:59:40.863 You need people to be ambitious,technically ambitious.
00:59:44.686 You know, if there arefive ways to do something,
00:59:47.585 we'll study them.
00:59:48.728 But let's study them veryquickly and make a decision.
00:59:51.045 We can always change our mind.
00:59:53.088 It doesn't you know,changing your mind is,
00:59:55.845 I took about one-waydoors and two-way doors.
00:59:59.898 Most decisions are two-way doors.
01:00:03.769 Can ou explain that?
01:00:04.785 'Cause I love that metaphor.
01:00:06.805 If you make the wrong decision,
01:00:10.026 if it's a two-way doordecision, you walk out the door,
01:00:12.825 you pick a door, you walk out,
01:00:14.909 and you spend a little time there.
01:00:16.546 It turns out to be the wrong decision,
01:00:17.823 you can come back inand pick another door.
01:00:20.308 Some decisions are so consequential
01:00:23.849 and so important and so hard to reverse
01:00:27.006 that they really areone-way door decisions.
01:00:29.090 You go in that door,you're not coming back.
01:00:32.585 And those decisions have to be made
01:00:35.168 very deliberately, very carefully.
01:00:38.109 If you can think of yet anotherway to analyze the decision,
01:00:41.687 you should slow down and do that.
01:00:43.363 So, you know, when Iwas the CEO of Amazon,
01:00:48.009 I often found myself in the position
01:00:49.588 of being the chief slowdown officer
01:00:52.212 because somebody would be bringing me
01:00:54.781 a one-way door decision.
01:00:56.364 And I would say okay, I canthink of three more ways
01:00:58.704 to analyze that.
01:00:59.593 So let's go do that.
01:01:00.960 Because we ha we are not gonna be able
01:01:02.820 to reverse this one easily.
01:01:03.859 Maybe you can reverse it,but it's gonna be very costly
01:01:06.463 and very time consuming.
01:01:07.787 We really have to get thisone right from the beginning.
01:01:10.632 And what happens,unfortunately in companies,
01:01:16.807 what can happen is that youhave a one size fits all
01:01:21.686 decision making process
01:01:24.043 where you end up usingthe heavyweight process
01:01:27.907 on all decisions.
01:01:29.068 For everything, yeah.
01:01:29.941 Including the lightweight ones.
01:01:31.407 The two-way door decisions.
01:01:33.344 Two-way door decisionsshould mostly be made
01:01:35.285 by single individualsor by very small teams
01:01:38.683 deep in the organization.
01:01:41.225 And one-way door decisions are the ones
01:01:43.969 the irreversible ones,
01:01:45.426 those are the ones thatshould be elevated up
01:01:47.802 to you know, the senior most executives
01:01:50.923 who should slow them down and make sure
01:01:53.089 that the right thing is being done.
01:01:55.149 Yeah, I mean, part of the skill here
01:01:57.146 is to know the differencein one-way and two-way,
01:01:59.041 I think you mentioned.
01:02:00.728 Yes.
01:02:01.561 I mean I think youmentioned Amazon Prime,
01:02:03.729 the decision to sortof create Amazon Prime
01:02:06.522 as a one-way door.
01:02:08.146 I mean, it's not, it'sunclear if it is or not,
01:02:10.527 but it probably is, and it'sa really big risk to go there.
01:02:14.648 There are a bunch ofdecisions like that that are
01:02:16.901 you know, changing the decision
01:02:20.325 is gonna be very, very complicated.
01:02:22.508 Some of them are technical decisions too,
01:02:24.447 because some technical decisions
01:02:26.131 are like quick drying cement.
01:02:28.029 You know, if you'regonna, once you make 'em,
01:02:29.830 it gets really hard.
01:02:30.850 I mean, you know,choosing which propellants
01:02:32.570 to use in a vehicle.
01:02:34.059 You know, selecting LNGfor the booster stage
01:02:36.869 and selecting hydrogenfor the upper stage,
01:02:40.063 that has turned out tobe a very good decision.
01:02:43.469 But if you changed yourmind, that would be a very,
01:02:48.572 that would be a very big setback.
01:02:50.592 Do you see what I'm saying?
01:02:52.130 Yeah.
01:02:53.129 So that's the kind of decision
01:02:54.533 you scrutinize very, very carefully.
01:02:57.587 Other things just aren't like that.
01:02:58.828 Most decisions are not that way.
01:03:01.586 Most decisions should bemade by single individuals,
01:03:04.250 but they need,
01:03:05.438 and done quickly in the full understanding
01:03:08.349 that you can always change your mind.
01:03:10.694 Yeah, one of the things I really liked,
01:03:12.970 perhaps it's not a two-way door decision
01:03:14.572 is I disagree and commit phrase.
01:03:19.008 So don't,
01:03:21.333 so somebody brings up an idea to you.
01:03:23.783 If it's a two-way door,
01:03:25.729 you state that you don'tunderstand enough to agree,
01:03:29.474 but you still back them.
01:03:32.286 I'd love for you to explain it.
01:03:33.325 Yeah, disagree and commit isa really important principle
01:03:36.704 that saves a lot of arguing.
01:03:38.593 Yeah.
01:03:39.426 So-
01:03:40.259 I'm gonna use that in my personal life.
01:03:41.725 I disagree, but commit.
01:03:44.143 It's very common inany endeavor in life,
01:03:47.362 in business, and any you know,
01:03:49.234 anybody where you have teammates.
01:03:51.329 You have a teammate andthe two of you disagree.
01:03:54.853 At some point you have to make a decision.
01:03:57.430 And you know, in companies
01:03:59.091 we tend to organize hierarchically.
01:04:00.926 So there's this you know,whoever's the more senior person
01:04:04.054 ultimately gets to make the decision.
01:04:06.295 So ultimately the CEO getsto make that decision.
01:04:09.425 And the CEO may notalways make the decision
01:04:11.891 that they agree with.
01:04:12.889 So like you know, I would often
01:04:15.567 I would be the one whowould disagree and commit.
01:04:17.974 One of my direct reportswould very much wanna do it,
01:04:22.148 do something in a particular way.
01:04:24.453 I would think it was a bad idea.
01:04:26.374 I would explain my point of view.
01:04:28.945 They would say Jeff, I thinkyou're wrong, and here's why.
01:04:33.220 And we would go back and forth
01:04:34.983 and I would often say you know what?
01:04:38.112 I don't think you're right,
01:04:40.167 but I'm gonna gamble with you
01:04:43.452 and you're closer to theground truth than I am.
01:04:48.050 I had known you for 20 years,you have great judgment.
01:04:52.111 I don't know that I'm right either.
01:04:53.826 Not really, not for sure.
01:04:55.148 All these decisions are complicated.
01:04:57.709 Let's do it your way.
01:04:59.004 But at least then you've made a decision.
01:05:01.416 And I'm agreeing tocommit to that decision.
01:05:05.347 So I'm not gonna be second guessing it.
01:05:06.771 I'm not gonna be sniping at it.
01:05:08.054 I'm not gonna be saying I told you so.
01:05:10.649 I'm gonna try actively tohelp make sure it works.
01:05:14.788 That's a really importantteammate behavior.
01:05:18.209 There's so many waysthat dispute resolution
01:05:21.829 is a really interesting thing on teams.
01:05:25.248 And there are so many wayswhen two people disagree
01:05:28.511 about something, even,I'm assuming in the case
01:05:30.212 where everybody's well intentioned,
01:05:32.268 they just have a very different opinion
01:05:33.828 about what the right decision is.
01:05:36.307 And we have, in our societyand inside companies,
01:05:40.158 we have a bunch of mechanisms
01:05:42.666 that we use to resolvethese kinds of disputes.
01:05:46.768 A lot of 'em are, I think really bad.
01:05:50.420 So, you know, an exampleof a really bad way
01:05:53.652 of coming to agreement is compromise.
01:05:57.234 So compromise, you know, look,
01:05:58.885 we're in a room here and I could say
01:06:01.350 Lex, how tall do youthink this ceiling is?
01:06:04.525 And you'd be like I don'tknow, Jeff, maybe 12 feet tall.
01:06:07.369 And I would say I think it's 11 feet tall.
01:06:11.392 Yeah.
01:06:12.225 And then we'd say you know what?
01:06:13.609 Let's just call it 11 and a half feet.
01:06:16.071 That's compromise.
01:06:17.877 Yeah.
01:06:18.710 Instead of the rightthing to do is you know,
01:06:21.484 to get a tape measureor figure out some way
01:06:23.815 of actually measuring,
01:06:26.065 but think getting that tape measure
01:06:27.364 and figure out how to getit to the top of the ceiling
01:06:29.608 and all these things that requires energy.
01:06:31.448 Compromise, the advantage of compromise
01:06:34.647 as a resolution mechanismis that it's low energy,
01:06:38.972 but it doesn't lead to truth.
01:06:41.392 And so in things like theheight of the ceiling,
01:06:44.626 where truth is a noble thing,
01:06:46.745 you shouldn't allow compromise to be used
01:06:48.829 when you can know the truth.
01:06:51.052 Another really bad resolution mechanism
01:06:54.157 that happens all the timeis just who's more stubborn.
01:06:58.024 Yeah.
01:06:58.894 This is also, let's saytwo executives who disagree
01:07:03.550 and they just have a war of attrition.
01:07:05.791 And whichever one gets exhausted first
01:07:09.494 capitulates to the other one.
01:07:11.131 Again, you haven't arrived at truth.
01:07:13.233 And this is very demoralizing.
01:07:15.973 So, you know, this is where escalation,
01:07:18.707 I try to ask people whoyou know, on my team
01:07:23.287 and say never get to a point
01:07:25.771 where you are resolvingsomething by you know,
01:07:28.430 who gets exhausted first.
01:07:31.228 Escalate that.
01:07:32.708 I'll help you make the decision.
01:07:34.328 Because that's so de-energized
01:07:37.927 and such a terrible, lousyway to make a decision.
01:07:40.828 So you want to get to the resolution
01:07:42.211 as quickly as possible
01:07:43.233 because that ultimately leadsto high velocity of decision.
01:07:45.505 Yes.
01:07:46.338 And you wanna try to get asclose to truth as possible.
01:07:48.865 So you want like you know,exhausting the other person
01:07:52.786 is not truth seeking.
01:07:54.486 Yes.
01:07:55.319 And compromise is not truth seeking.
01:07:57.890 So, you know, it doesn't mean,
01:07:59.551 now, and there are a lot of cases
01:08:01.187 where no one knows the real truth
01:08:02.546 and that's where disagreeingcommit can come in.
01:08:04.667 But it's escalation is betterthan more of attrition.
01:08:09.889 Escalate to you know, to your boss
01:08:13.291 and say hey, we can't agree on this.
01:08:14.786 We like each other, we'rerespectful of each other,
01:08:16.670 but we strongly disagree with each other.
01:08:18.934 We need you to you know,make a decision here
01:08:20.984 so we can move forward.
01:08:22.810 But decisiveness, movingforward quickly on decisions
01:08:27.919 as quickly as you responsibly can
01:08:30.849 is how you increase velocity.
01:08:32.535 Most of what slows thingsdown is taking too long
01:08:35.527 to make decisions at all scale levels.
01:08:38.890 You know, so it has tobe part of the culture
01:08:41.608 to get high velocity.
01:08:43.094 You know, Amazon has amillion and a half people
01:08:45.712 and the company is still fast.
01:08:48.028 We're still decisive, we're still quick.
01:08:50.611 And that's because theculture supports that.
01:08:53.286 At every scale in a distributed way.
01:08:55.582 Yes.
01:08:56.415 Try to maximize thevelocity of decisions.
01:08:58.111 Exactly.
01:08:59.830 You've mentioned the lunar program.
01:09:01.792 Let me ask you about that.
01:09:03.109 Yeah.
01:09:04.379 There's a lot going on there
01:09:06.264 and you haven't reallytalked about it much.
01:09:08.307 So in addition to theArtemis program with NASA,
01:09:11.393 Blue is doing its own lander program.
01:09:13.584 Can you describe it?
01:09:15.229 There's a sexy picture onInstagram with one of them.
01:09:19.149 Is it the MK1, I guess?
01:09:20.680 Yeah,
01:09:21.514 The MK1.
01:09:22.346 The picture is me with BillNelson, the NASA administrator.
01:09:26.474 Just to clarify, theLander is the sexy thing
01:09:29.069 about the Instagram.
01:09:30.573 Really wanna clarify that.
01:09:31.478 I know it's not me.
01:09:32.310 I know it was either the lander or Bill.
01:09:34.290 Okay.
01:09:36.622 I love Bill, but-
01:09:37.456 Thank you for clarifying.
01:09:38.680 Okay.
01:09:39.779 Yes, the MK1 Lander isdesigned to take 3000 kilograms
01:09:47.573 to the surface of the moonin a cargo, expendable cargo.
01:09:50.872 It's an expendable lander.
01:09:52.211 Lands on the moon, stays there,
01:09:54.095 take 3000 kilograms to the surface.
01:09:56.137 It can be launched on asingle New Glenn flight,
01:09:59.893 which is very important.
01:10:01.356 So it's a relatively simple architecture,
01:10:04.130 just like the human landing system lander
01:10:06.932 that they called the MK2.
01:10:08.935 MK1 is also fueled with liquid hydrogen,
01:10:14.275 and which is for high energy emissions,
01:10:18.710 like landing on the surface of the moon,
01:10:20.777 the high specific impulse of hydrogen
01:10:22.971 is a very big advantage.
01:10:24.710 The disadvantage ofhydrogen has always been
01:10:28.033 that it's, since it's such a deep cryogen,
01:10:31.394 it's not storable.
01:10:33.153 So it's constantly boiling off
01:10:35.089 and you're losing propellantbecause it's boiling off.
01:10:39.168 And so we're doing, aspart of our lunar program,
01:10:43.590 it's developing solar powered cryo coolers
01:10:46.714 that can actually makehydrogen a storable propellant
01:10:50.516 for deep space.
01:10:52.274 And that's a real game changer.
01:10:53.749 It's a game changer forany high energy mission.
01:10:56.306 So to the moon, but to the outer planets,
01:10:58.892 to Mars, everywhere.
01:11:00.457 So the idea with MK1, both MK1 and MK2
01:11:03.386 is the New Glenn can carryit from the surface of earth
01:11:09.771 to the surface of the moon.
01:11:12.671 Exactly.
01:11:13.875 So the Mk1 is expendable.
01:11:16.499 The lunar lander we'redeveloping for NASA,
01:11:20.402 the Mk2 lander, that's partof the Artemis program.
01:11:24.916 They call it thesustaining lander program.
01:11:27.670 So that lander is designed to be reusable.
01:11:31.713 It can land on the surface of the moon
01:11:34.193 in a single stage configurationand then take off.
01:11:36.671 So the whole you know,
01:11:38.436 if you look at the Apollo program,
01:11:41.690 the lunar lander and Apollowas really two stages.
01:11:44.824 It would land on the surface
01:11:47.095 and then it would leave the descent stage
01:11:49.564 on the surface of the moon,
01:11:50.850 and only the absent stage would go back up
01:11:53.012 into lunar orbit where it would rendezvous
01:11:55.352 with the command module.
01:11:56.979 Here what we're doing is wehave a single stage lunar lander
01:12:00.733 that carries down enough propellant
01:12:02.571 so that it can bringthe whole thing back up
01:12:04.466 so that it can be reused over and over.
01:12:07.415 And the point of doing that, of course,
01:12:08.935 is to reduce cost so thatyou can make lunar missions
01:12:12.964 more affordable over time,
01:12:14.791 which is, that's one ofNASA's big objectives
01:12:17.711 because this time thewhole point of Artemis
01:12:21.552 is go back to the moon,but this time to stay.
01:12:25.530 So, you know, back in the Apollo program,
01:12:28.730 we went to the moon six timesand then ended the program
01:12:31.871 and it really was tooexpensive to continue.
01:12:36.196 And so there's a few questions there,
01:12:38.953 but one is how do you stay on the moon?
01:12:40.689 What ideas do you have about-
01:12:43.533 Yeah.
01:12:44.366 Like sustaining life wherea few folks can stay there
01:12:49.575 for prolonged periods of time?
01:12:51.823 Well, one of the things we're working on
01:12:55.271 is using lunar resourceslike lunar regolith
01:13:00.389 to manufacture commoditiesand even solar cells
01:13:05.072 on the surface of the moon.
01:13:06.907 We've already built a solar cell
01:13:09.290 that is completely made fromlunar regolith stimulant,
01:13:13.255 and this solar cell is onlyabout 7% power efficient.
01:13:18.996 So it's very inefficientcompared to you know,
01:13:21.614 the more advanced solar cellsthat we make here on earth.
01:13:25.555 But if you can figure out how
01:13:27.332 to make a practical solar cell factory
01:13:31.180 that you can land onthe surface of the moon,
01:13:33.909 and then the raw materialfor those solar cells
01:13:37.551 is simply lunar regolith,
01:13:39.574 then you can just you know, continue
01:13:41.791 to churn out solar cellson the surface of the moon,
01:13:45.577 have lots of power onthe surface of the moon.
01:13:48.114 That will make it easier forpeople to live on the moon.
01:13:51.254 Similarly, we're working on extracting
01:13:55.074 oxygen from lunar regolith.
01:13:58.214 So lunar regolith by weighthas a lot of oxygen in it.
01:14:02.516 It's bound very tightly, you know,
01:14:04.960 as oxides with other elements.
01:14:06.991 And so you have to separate the oxygen,
01:14:10.793 which is very energy intensive.
01:14:12.791 So that also could worktogether with the solar cells.
01:14:17.417 But if you can,
01:14:18.468 and then ultimately we may be able
01:14:22.032 to find practical quantities of ice
01:14:26.310 in the permanently shadowed craters
01:14:29.559 on the poles of the moon.
01:14:31.895 And we know there is ice water
01:14:35.153 in those, or water ice in those craters.
01:14:39.299 And we know that we can breakthat down with electrolysis
01:14:44.036 into hydrogen and oxygen.
01:14:46.274 And then you'd not only have oxygen,
01:14:48.253 but you'd also have a verygood high efficiency propellant
01:14:54.532 fuel in hydrogen.
01:14:57.176 So there's a lot we can do
01:14:58.534 to make the moon moresustainable over time.
01:15:02.435 But the very first step, the thing,
01:15:04.490 the kind of gate that allof that has to go through
01:15:07.654 is we need to be ableto land cargo and humans
01:15:13.093 on the surface of the moonat an acceptable cost.
01:15:16.593 To fast forward a little bit,
01:15:18.226 is there any chance Jeff Bezos steps foot
01:15:21.829 on the moon and on Mars?
01:15:25.185 One or the other, or both?
01:15:27.848 It's very unlikely.
01:15:29.905 I think it's probablysomething that gets done
01:15:33.146 by future generations bythe time it gets to me.
01:15:34.789 I think in my lifetimethat's probably gonna be done
01:15:38.228 by professional astronauts.
01:15:40.679 Sadly, I would love tosign up for that mission.
01:15:43.827 So don't count me out yet, Lex, you know,
01:15:46.284 give me a fighting shot here maybe.
01:15:50.158 But I think if we areplacing reasonable bets
01:15:54.941 on such a thing,
01:15:56.250 in my lifetime, thatwill continue to be done
01:15:58.308 by professional astronauts.
01:15:59.448 Yeah, so these arerisky, difficult missions.
01:16:02.449 And probably missions thatrequire a lot of training.
01:16:05.332 You know, you are going therefor a very specific purpose
01:16:08.351 to do something.
01:16:09.579 We're gonna be able todo a lot on the moon too
01:16:11.770 with automation.
01:16:13.027 So, you know, in terms ofsetting up these factories
01:16:15.783 and doing all that, we aresophisticated enough now
01:16:19.226 with automation and weprobably don't need humans
01:16:21.272 to tend those factories and machines.
01:16:24.012 So there's a lot that'sgonna be done in both modes.
01:16:28.732 So I have to ask thebigger picture question
01:16:31.200 about the two companiespushing humanity forward
01:16:36.740 out towards the stars,Blue Origin and SpaceX.
01:16:39.730 Are you competitors, collaborators?
01:16:42.089 Which, and to what degree?
01:16:44.145 Well, I would say you know,just like the internet is big
01:16:47.256 and there are lots ofwinners at all scale levels.
01:16:49.444 I mean, there are halfa dozen giant companies
01:16:51.795 that you know, the internet has made,
01:16:54.409 but they're a bunch ofmedium sized companies
01:16:56.268 and a bunch of smallcompanies, all successful,
01:16:58.891 all with profits, dreams,
01:17:00.416 all driving great customer experiences.
01:17:03.370 That's what we wanna see in space.
01:17:06.103 That kind of dynamism and space is big.
01:17:09.094 There's room for a bunch of winners
01:17:11.494 and it's gonna happen at all skill levels.
01:17:12.875 And so you know, SpaceX isgonna be successful for sure.
01:17:17.656 I want Blue Origin to be successful
01:17:20.216 and I hope there are another you know,
01:17:22.457 five companies right behind us.
01:17:25.412 But, you know, I spoke toElon a few times recently
01:17:28.948 about you, about Blue Origin,and he was very positive
01:17:32.355 about you as a person and very supportive
01:17:34.871 of all the efforts you'vebeen leading at Blue.
01:17:37.173 What's your thoughts?
01:17:38.371 You worked with a lot ofleaders at Amazon, at Blue.
01:17:42.351 What's your thoughts aboutElon as a human being
01:17:44.435 and a leader?
01:17:46.249 Well, I don't reallyknow Elon very well.
01:17:49.235 You know, I know his public persona,
01:17:53.113 but I also know you can't know anyone
01:17:55.871 by their public persona.
01:17:57.554 It's impossible.
01:17:58.749 I mean you may think you do,
01:18:00.628 but I guarantee you don't.
01:18:02.273 So I don't really know,
01:18:03.352 you know Elon way better than I do Lex,
01:18:06.736 but in terms of his,judging by the results,
01:18:10.191 he must be a very capable leader.
01:18:13.290 There's no way you couldhave you know, Tesla
01:18:16.568 and SpaceX without being a capable leader.
01:18:19.968 It's impossible.
01:18:22.757 Yeah, I just, I hope youguys hang out sometimes,
01:18:25.894 shake hands, and sort ofhave a kind of friendship
01:18:30.146 that would inspire justthe entirety of humanity.
01:18:32.471 'cause you, what you're doing
01:18:34.468 is like one of the big grandchallenges ahead for humanity.
01:18:40.408 Well, I agree with you
01:18:41.631 and I think in a lot of these endeavors,
01:18:44.093 we're very like-minded.
01:18:45.648 Yeah.
01:18:46.481 And so I think, you know,
01:18:48.307 I'm not saying we're identical,
01:18:50.495 but I think we're very like-minded.
01:18:51.866 And so I, you know, I love that idea.
01:18:56.053 All right, going back to sexypictures on your Instagram,
01:18:58.967 there's a video of you fromthe early days of Amazon
01:19:03.778 giving a tour of yourquote sort of offices.
01:19:06.593 I think your dad is holding the camera.
01:19:07.961 He is, yeah.
01:19:08.794 I know, right.
01:19:10.093 Yes.
01:19:10.926 This is what the giant orangeextension cord and yeah.
01:19:12.946 And you're like explaining the genius
01:19:15.010 of the extension cordand how this is a desk
01:19:16.809 and the CRT monitor and sort of
01:19:21.147 that's where all the magic happens.
01:19:23.226 I forget what your dad said,
01:19:24.778 but this is like the center of it all.
01:19:27.309 So what was it like,
01:19:29.468 what was going throughyour mind at that time?
01:19:32.208 You left a good job in NewYork and took this leap.
01:19:36.469 Were you excited?
01:19:37.468 Were you scared?
01:19:38.346 So excited and scared.
01:19:40.282 Anxious, you know, thoughtthe odds of success were low,
01:19:43.918 told all of our early investors
01:19:45.891 that I thought there wasa 30% chance of success
01:19:48.311 by which I mean just begetting your money back.
01:19:50.790 Not like, not what actually happened.
01:19:54.012 Because that's the truth.
01:19:55.132 Every startup company is unlikely to work.
01:19:58.322 It's helpful to be in reality about that,
01:20:02.731 but that doesn't meanyou can't be optimistic.
01:20:05.144 So you kind of have to havethis duality in your head.
01:20:07.281 Like on the one hand,
01:20:08.306 you know what the baseline statistics say
01:20:11.905 about startup companies.
01:20:14.088 And the other hand youhave to ignore all of that
01:20:16.758 and just be a hundredpercent sure it's gonna work.
01:20:19.581 And you're doing boththings at the same time.
01:20:22.069 You're holding thatcontradiction in your head.
01:20:24.529 But it was so, it was so exciting.
01:20:26.865 I love you know, every, from 1994
01:20:30.754 when the company was founded to 1995,
01:20:33.854 when we opened our doors
01:20:35.810 all the way until today,I find Amazon so exciting.
01:20:40.785 And that doesn't meanit's like full of pain,
01:20:43.667 full of problems, you know,
01:20:45.740 it's like there's so manythings that need to be resolved
01:20:49.493 and worked and made better, and et cetera.
01:20:52.929 But on balance, it's so fun.
01:20:55.553 It's such a privilege.
01:20:57.010 It's been such a joy.
01:20:58.334 I feel so grateful that I'vebeen part of that journey.
01:21:03.411 It's just been incredible.
01:21:04.838 So in some sense, you don'twant a single day of comfort.
01:21:07.758 You've written about this many times.
01:21:10.251 We'll talk about your writing,
01:21:12.196 which I would highly recommend people read
01:21:14.710 and just the letters to shareholders.
01:21:17.072 So you wrote up explainingthe idea of day one thinking,
01:21:21.693 I think you first wrote aboutin 97 letters to shareholders.
01:21:25.995 Then you also, in a waywrote it about sad to say,
01:21:30.078 is your last letter toshareholders as CEO.
01:21:35.007 And you said that day two is stasis
01:21:37.889 followed by irrelevance,
01:21:40.493 followed by excruciating painfuldecline, followed by death.
01:21:45.993 And that is why it's always day one.
01:21:49.728 Can you explain this day one thing?
01:21:52.053 This is a really powerful way
01:21:53.329 to describe the beginningand the journey of Amazon.
01:21:56.152 It's really a very simple,
01:22:00.313 and I think age old ideaabout renewal and rebirth.
01:22:05.132 And like every day is day one.
01:22:08.493 Every day you are decidingwhat you're gonna do.
01:22:12.308 And you are not trapped
01:22:16.132 by what you were or who you were,
01:22:18.527 or any self-consistency.
01:22:20.911 Self-consistency even can be a trap.
01:22:23.969 And so day one thinking is kind of,
01:22:27.727 we start fresh every day
01:22:30.312 and we get to make new decisionsevery day about invention,
01:22:35.892 about customers, about howwe're going to operate,
01:22:40.767 what our, even as deeplyas what our principles are.
01:22:44.513 We can go back to that.
01:22:45.854 It turns out we don'tchange those very often,
01:22:48.013 but we change them occasionally.
01:22:50.515 And when we work on programs at Amazon,
01:22:56.175 we often make a list of tenants.
01:22:59.234 And this, the tenants are kind of,
01:23:02.114 they're not principles.
01:23:03.373 They're a little moretactical than principles,
01:23:05.701 but it's kind of the main ideas
01:23:08.755 that we want this program to embody,
01:23:10.642 whatever those are.
01:23:12.587 And one of the things that we do
01:23:15.453 is we put, these are thetenets for this program.
01:23:17.550 And in parentheses we always put,
01:23:19.633 unless you know a better way.
01:23:22.837 And that idea, unlessyou know a better way,
01:23:28.195 is so important because you never want
01:23:30.872 to get trapped by dogma.
01:23:33.192 You never wanna get trapped by history.
01:23:35.475 It doesn't mean you discardhistory or ignore it.
01:23:38.871 There's so much value inwhat has worked in the past.
01:23:42.412 But you can't be blindlyfollowing what you've done.
01:23:46.609 And that's the heart of day one
01:23:48.673 is you're always starting fresh.
01:23:51.270 And to the question ofhow to fend off day two,
01:23:54.603 you said such a question,
01:23:55.724 can't have a simpleanswer as you're saying,
01:23:58.172 there will be many elements,multiple paths, and many traps.
01:24:01.249 I don't know the whole answer,
01:24:03.170 but I may know bits of it.
01:24:05.091 Here's a starter pack of essentials.
01:24:07.189 Maybe others come to mindfor day one, defense,
01:24:10.630 customer obsession, askeptical view of proxies,
01:24:14.392 the eager adoption of external trends
01:24:17.120 and high velocity decision making.
01:24:19.453 So we talked about highvelocity decision making,
01:24:22.275 that's more difficult than it sounds.
01:24:24.672 So maybe you can pick onethat stands out to you
01:24:28.088 as you can comment on.
01:24:29.792 Eager adoption of external trends,
01:24:32.195 high velocity decision making,
01:24:33.490 skeptical view of proxies.
01:24:35.066 How do you fight off day two?
01:24:36.680 Well, you know, I'll talk about,
01:24:38.471 because I think it's the onethat is maybe in some ways
01:24:41.855 the hardest to understand isthe skeptical view of proxies.
01:24:49.413 One of the things thathappens in business,
01:24:52.832 probably anything that you're,
01:24:54.655 where you're you know, youhave an ongoing program
01:24:58.129 and something is underwayfor a number of years,
01:25:01.728 is you develop certain thingsthat you're managing to
01:25:04.761 like, let's say the typicalcase would be a metric.
01:25:08.117 And that metric isn't thereal underlying thing.
01:25:12.929 And so you know, maybe the metric
01:25:17.190 is efficiency metricaround customer contacts
01:25:20.412 per unit sold or something.
01:25:22.438 If you sell a million units,
01:25:24.609 how many customer contacts do you get?
01:25:26.652 Or how many returns do you get?
01:25:28.705 And so on and so on.
01:25:29.630 And so what happens is a little bit
01:25:31.935 of a kind of a inertia sets in
01:25:36.191 where somebody a long timeago invented that metric
01:25:40.334 and they invented that metric.
01:25:42.070 They decided we needto watch for you know,
01:25:44.915 customer returns per unitsold as an important metric.
01:25:50.130 But they had a reason whythey chose that metric.
01:25:53.552 The person who invented that metric
01:25:55.532 and decided it was worth watching.
01:25:57.715 And then fast forward five years,
01:25:59.456 that metric is the proxy.
01:26:01.313 The proxy for truth, I guess.
01:26:03.090 The proxy for truth,the proxy for customer,
01:26:06.245 let's say in this case, it's aproxy for customer happiness.
01:26:09.696 And, but that metric is notactually customer happiness,
01:26:12.813 it's a proxy for customer happiness.
01:26:15.553 The person who invented the metric
01:26:17.767 understood that connection.
01:26:20.354 Five years later, a kindof inertia can set in
01:26:25.637 and you forget the truth
01:26:29.054 behind why you were watchingthat metric in the first place.
01:26:32.048 And the world shifts a little.
01:26:34.733 And now that proxy isn't asvaluable as it used to be
01:26:38.117 or it's missing something.
01:26:40.689 And you have to be on alert for that.
01:26:42.529 You have to know, okay, this is,
01:26:44.487 I don't really care about this metric.
01:26:46.772 I care about customer happiness.
01:26:49.674 And this metric is worthputting energy into
01:26:54.853 and following andimproving and scrutinizing
01:26:58.371 only in so much as it actuallyaffects customer happiness.
01:27:03.405 And so you've gottaconstantly be on guard.
01:27:05.368 And it's very, very common.
01:27:07.194 This is a nuanced problem.
01:27:09.371 It's very common, especiallyin large companies,
01:27:12.593 that they're managing to metrics
01:27:14.915 that they don't really understand.
01:27:17.034 They don't really know why they exist.
01:27:19.510 And the world may have shiftedout from under them a little.
01:27:22.357 And the metrics are no longeras relevant as they were
01:27:25.487 when somebody 10 yearsearlier invented the metric.
01:27:29.469 That is a nuance, butthat's a big problem, right?
01:27:33.717 It's a huge problem.
01:27:34.815 That something so compelling
01:27:36.171 to have a nice metric to try to optimize.
01:27:38.768 Yes.
01:27:39.601 And by the way, you do need metrics.
01:27:41.429 Yes you do.
01:27:42.262 You know, you can'tignore them, and want them,
01:27:45.765 but you just have tobe constantly on guard.
01:27:48.450 This is, you know, a way toslip into day two thinking
01:27:52.046 would be to manage yourbusiness to metrics
01:27:54.865 that you don't really understand.
01:27:56.928 And you're not really surewhy they were invented
01:27:59.236 in the first place,
01:28:00.069 and you're not surethey're still as relevant
01:28:02.336 as they used to be.
01:28:03.348 What does it take to be the guy or gal
01:28:05.854 who brings up the point thatthis proxy might be outdated?
01:28:09.993 I guess what does ittake to have a culture
01:28:13.011 that enables that in the meeting?
01:28:14.712 'Cause that's a very uncomfortable thing
01:28:16.799 to bring up at a meeting.
01:28:18.018 We all showed up here, it's a Friday.
01:28:20.070 This is such,
01:28:21.408 you have just asked amillion dollar question.
01:28:25.248 So this is what you're,
01:28:27.872 if I generalize what you're asking,
01:28:31.454 you are talking in generalabout truth telling.
01:28:34.995 Yeah.
01:28:36.006 And we humans are notreally truth seeking animals.
01:28:41.328 We are social animals.
01:28:43.296 Yeah, we are.
01:28:44.308 And you know, take youback in time 10,000 years
01:28:47.392 and you're in a small village,
01:28:49.852 if you go along to getalong, you can survive.
01:28:53.652 You can procreate.
01:28:55.353 If you're the village truth teller,
01:28:58.093 you might get clubbed to deathin the middle of the night.
01:29:01.130 Truths are often, theydon't want to be heard.
01:29:05.250 'Cause important truthscan be uncomfortable,
01:29:10.232 they can be awkward,they can be exhausting.
01:29:12.838 Impolite and all that kind of stuff.
01:29:15.833 Yes, challenging.
01:29:16.837 They can make people defensive
01:29:18.031 even if that's not the intent.
01:29:19.751 But any high performing organization,
01:29:22.549 whether it's a sportsteam, a business, you know,
01:29:24.837 a political organization,an activist group,
01:29:27.489 I don't care what it is.
01:29:29.310 Any high performing organization
01:29:32.453 has to have mechanisms and a culture
01:29:36.593 that supports truth telling.
01:29:38.409 One of the things you have to do
01:29:40.034 is you have to talk about that.
01:29:41.352 And you have to talk about the fact
01:29:42.887 that it takes energy to do that.
01:29:45.519 And you have to talk to people,
01:29:46.714 you have to remind people it'sokay that it's uncomfortable.
01:29:50.413 You have to literally tell people
01:29:53.914 it's not what we'redesigned to do as humans.
01:29:56.514 It's not really, it'skind of a side effect.
01:29:59.556 You know, we can do that,
01:30:01.088 but it's not how we survive.
01:30:02.670 We mostly survive by being social animals
01:30:05.593 and being cordial and cooperative.
01:30:08.171 And that's really important.
01:30:10.771 And so there's a, you know,
01:30:12.635 science is all about truth telling.
01:30:14.771 It's actually a very formal mechanism
01:30:18.916 for trying to tell the truth.
01:30:22.088 And even in science,
01:30:24.193 you find that it's hard to tell the truth.
01:30:27.270 Right.
01:30:29.148 Even, you know, you'resupposed to have hypothesis
01:30:31.630 and test it and find dataand reject the hypothesis,
01:30:34.289 and so on.
01:30:36.931 It's not easy.
01:30:37.775 But even in science, there'slike the senior scientists
01:30:40.327 and the junior scientists.
01:30:41.546 Correct.
01:30:42.379 And then there's a hierarchy of humans
01:30:43.877 where somehow seniority matters.
01:30:46.130 Yes.
01:30:47.921 In the scientific process, which is odd.
01:30:49.810 And that's true inside companies too.
01:30:52.596 And so you wanna set up your culture
01:30:55.553 so that the most junior person
01:30:58.769 can overrule the most seniorperson if they have data.
01:31:04.230 And that really is abouttrying to you know,
01:31:09.135 there are little things you can do.
01:31:10.731 So for example, in everymeeting that I attend,
01:31:13.602 I always speak last.
01:31:16.375 And I know from experience that,
01:31:21.476 you know, if I speak first,
01:31:24.756 even very strong-willed,highly intelligent,
01:31:31.275 high judgment participants in that meeting
01:31:35.086 will wonder, well if Jeff thinks that
01:31:38.975 I came in this meeting thinking one thing,
01:31:41.172 but maybe I'm not right.
01:31:44.550 And so you can do little things
01:31:47.233 like if you're the most seniorperson in the room, go last.
01:31:52.129 Let everybody else go first.
01:31:53.456 In fact, ideally let's try tohave the most junior person
01:31:57.693 go first and the secondand try to go in order
01:32:00.393 of seniority so that youcan hear everyone's opinion
01:32:05.693 in a kind of unfiltered way.
01:32:07.762 Because we really do,
01:32:09.251 we actually literally change our opinions.
01:32:11.602 If somebody who you reallyrespect says something,
01:32:15.434 it makes you change your mind a little.
01:32:17.512 So you're sayingimplicitly or explicitly
01:32:21.372 give permission for peopleto have a strong opinion
01:32:25.816 as long as it's backed by data.
01:32:27.694 Yes.
01:32:28.527 And sometimes it can even, by the way,
01:32:30.747 a lot of our most powerfultruths turn out to be hunches.
01:32:34.416 They turn out to be based on anecdotes.
01:32:36.867 They're intuition based.
01:32:38.613 And sometimes you don'teven have strong data,
01:32:41.709 but you may know the person well enough
01:32:44.871 to trust their judgment.
01:32:45.924 You may feel yourself leaning in.
01:32:47.678 It may resonate with aset of anecdotes you have.
01:32:51.012 And then you may be able to say you know,
01:32:53.052 something about that feels right.
01:32:56.753 Let's go collect some data on that.
01:32:58.692 Let's try to see if we canactually know whether it's right.
01:33:02.868 But for now, let's not disregard it
01:33:05.208 'cause it feels right.
01:33:06.732 You can also fight inherent bias.
01:33:08.411 There's an optimism bias.
01:33:10.772 Like if there are twointerpretations of a new set of data
01:33:14.134 and one of them is happyand one of 'em is unhappy,
01:33:18.232 it's a little dangerousto jump to the conclusion
01:33:20.626 that the happy interpretation is right.
01:33:23.056 You may want to sort ofcompensate for that human bias
01:33:27.833 of looking for you know, tryingto find the silver lining
01:33:31.590 and say look, that might be good,
01:33:32.950 but I'm gonna go with it'sbad for now until we're sure.
01:33:36.610 So speaking of happinessbias, data collection,
01:33:40.124 and anecdotes, you have to,
01:33:42.253 how's that for a transition?
01:33:45.263 You have to tell me thestory of the call you made,
01:33:51.478 the customer service call you made
01:33:53.146 to demonstrate a point about wait times.
01:33:57.365 Yeah, this is very earlyin the history of Amazon.
01:34:00.985 And we were going overa weekly business review
01:34:05.120 and a set of documents,and I have a saying,
01:34:09.228 which is when the data andthe anecdotes disagree,
01:34:12.259 the anecdotes are usually right.
01:34:14.505 And it doesn't mean you just slavishly
01:34:17.749 go follow the anecdotes then.
01:34:19.213 It means you go examine the data.
01:34:20.908 'Cause the data,
01:34:21.787 and it's usually not that thedata is being miscollected,
01:34:26.169 it's usually that you're notmeasuring the right thing.
01:34:30.179 And so, you know, if youhave a bunch of customers
01:34:32.619 complaining about something,
01:34:34.607 and at the same time, you know,
01:34:37.073 your metrics look like why are,
01:34:38.981 they shouldn't be complaining.
01:34:41.763 You should doubt the metrics.
01:34:43.832 And an early example ofthis was we had metrics
01:34:48.865 that showed that ourcustomers were waiting,
01:34:51.932 I think less than I don't know, 60 seconds
01:34:54.490 when they called a 1-800 number to get,
01:34:57.122 you know, phone customer service.
01:34:59.192 The wait time was supposedto be less than 60 seconds.
01:35:02.733 And, but we had a lot of complaints
01:35:04.689 that it was longer than that.
01:35:06.529 And anecdotally itseemed longer than that.
01:35:09.723 Like, you know, I would callcustomer service myself.
01:35:12.311 And so one day we're ina meeting, we're going
01:35:14.361 through the WBR and theweekly business review,
01:35:17.840 and we get to this metric in the deck,
01:35:20.507 and the guy who leads customer service
01:35:23.247 is to fit in the metric.
01:35:24.490 And I said, okay,
01:35:25.636 let's call picked up the phone.
01:35:31.189 And I dialed the 1-800 numberand called customer service.
01:35:34.920 And we just waited in silence.
01:35:38.691 What did it turn out tobe, like a couple minutes?
01:35:40.120 Oh, it was really long.
01:35:41.165 More than 10 minutes, I think.
01:35:42.844 Oh wow.
01:35:43.677 I mean it was many minutes.
01:35:45.411 And so, you know, itdramatically made the point
01:35:47.989 that something was wrongwith the data collection.
01:35:50.441 We weren't measuring the right thing.
01:35:52.767 And that, you know, setoff a whole chain of events
01:35:54.379 where we started measuring it right.
01:35:56.083 And that's an example bythe way of truth telling,
01:36:00.859 is like that's anuncomfortable thing to do.
01:36:03.483 But you have to seek trutheven when it's uncomfortable
01:36:09.142 and you have to get people's attention
01:36:11.028 and they have to buy into it,
01:36:13.327 and they have to get energizedaround really fixing things.
01:36:16.180 So that speaks to the obsession
01:36:19.045 with the customer experience.
01:36:19.942 So one of the definingaspects of your approach
01:36:22.953 to Amazon is just being obsessed
01:36:25.772 with making customers happy.
01:36:27.085 I think companies sometimes say that,
01:36:30.504 but Amazon is really obsessed with that.
01:36:34.283 I think there's somethingreally profound to that,
01:36:37.294 which is seeing the worldthrough the eyes of the customer,
01:36:39.769 like the customerexperience, truly like being,
01:36:43.130 that's using the product,that's enjoying the product.
01:36:46.624 They like the subtle little things
01:36:50.354 that make up their experience.
01:36:52.566 Like how do you optimize those?
01:36:55.245 This is another really good
01:37:00.284 and kind of deep question
01:37:02.466 because there are big things
01:37:04.730 that are really important to manage.
01:37:07.145 And then there are smallthings internally in Amazon,
01:37:11.447 we call them paper cuts.
01:37:13.449 So we have, we're alwaysworking on the big things,
01:37:16.526 like if you ask me,
01:37:17.606 and most of the energygoes into the big things
01:37:20.284 as it should.
01:37:21.421 So, and you can identify the big things.
01:37:23.765 And and I would encourage anybody
01:37:25.765 if anybody listening tothis as a entrepreneur,
01:37:29.482 has a small business, whatever,
01:37:33.082 you know, think about the things
01:37:34.663 that are not going tochange over 10 years.
01:37:37.087 And those are probably the big things.
01:37:38.707 So like I know in ourretail business at Amazon,
01:37:43.252 10 years from now,
01:37:44.407 customers are still gonna want low prices.
01:37:45.905 I know they're stillgonna want fast delivery.
01:37:47.942 And I just know they're stillgonna want big selection.
01:37:50.386 So it's impossible to imagine a scenario
01:37:53.208 where 10 years from now I say,
01:37:55.483 where a customer says, I love Amazon,
01:37:57.126 I just wish the priceswere a little higher.
01:37:59.129 Or I love Amazon,
01:38:00.226 I just wish you delivereda little more slowly.
01:38:02.568 So when you identify the big things,
01:38:05.862 you can tell they'reworth putting energy into
01:38:08.580 because they're stable in time.
01:38:10.901 Okay, but you're asking aboutsomething a little different,
01:38:14.425 which is in every customer experience,
01:38:16.886 there are those big things.
01:38:18.584 And by the way, it'sastonishingly hard to focus
01:38:20.864 even on just the big things.
01:38:22.569 So even though they're obvious,
01:38:24.746 they're really hard to focus on.
01:38:27.184 But in addition to that,
01:38:28.949 there are all these little tiny
01:38:30.859 customer experience deficiencies.
01:38:33.906 And we call those paper cuts
01:38:35.781 and we make long lists of them.
01:38:38.225 And then we have dedicatedteams that go fix paper cuts
01:38:44.849 because the teamsworking on the big issues
01:38:47.386 never get to the paper cuts
01:38:49.864 and they never work theirway down the list to get to,
01:38:52.831 they're working on bigthings as they should
01:38:56.623 and as you want them to.
01:38:58.566 And so you need special teams
01:39:01.034 who are charged with fixing paper cuts.
01:39:04.900 Well, where would you put,on the paper cuts spectrum,
01:39:08.318 the buy now with one click button,
01:39:10.202 which is I think pretty genius.
01:39:12.364 So to me like, okay,
01:39:14.686 my interaction with thingsI love on the internet,
01:39:18.381 there's things I do a lot.
01:39:19.879 I may be representing regular human,
01:39:22.523 I would love for thosethings to be frictionless.
01:39:25.642 For example, booking airline tickets.
01:39:28.849 Just saying, but youknow, it's buying a thing
01:39:35.126 with one click, making thatexperience frictionless,
01:39:38.824 intuitive, all aspects of that.
01:39:41.038 Like that just fundamentallymakes my life better.
01:39:46.225 Not just in terms of efficiency,
01:39:47.702 in terms of some kind of-
01:39:49.029 Cognitive load.
01:39:50.068 Yeah, cognitive load andinner peace and happiness.
01:39:53.725 First of all, buying stuffisn't a pleasant experience.
01:39:58.360 Having enough money to buy a thing
01:40:01.184 and then buying it isa pleasant experience.
01:40:04.424 And like having painaround that is somehow
01:40:06.524 just you're ruining abeautiful experience.
01:40:10.066 And I guess all I'm saying
01:40:12.365 as a person who loves goodideas, is that a paper cut,
01:40:16.126 a solution to a paper cut?
01:40:17.462 Yes.
01:40:18.466 So it's probably, that particular thing
01:40:20.887 is probably a solution toa number of paper cuts.
01:40:23.404 So if you go back andlook at our order pipeline
01:40:25.850 and how people shopped on Amazon,
01:40:27.725 before we invented 1-click shopping,
01:40:30.447 there were a whole,there was more friction.
01:40:32.843 There was a whole series of paper cuts
01:40:36.087 and that invention eliminateda bunch of paper cuts.
01:40:40.525 And I think you'reabsolutely right by the way,
01:40:44.263 that there, when youcome up with something
01:40:47.059 like 1-click shopping,
01:40:48.617 again, this is like soingrained in people now,
01:40:51.827 I'm impressed that you even notice it.
01:40:54.353 I mean, most people-
01:40:55.203 Every time I click the button.
01:40:56.506 I just, surge of happiness.
01:41:00.801 This, there is in the perfect invention
01:41:03.987 for the perfect moment,in the perfect context,
01:41:06.682 there is real beauty.
01:41:08.981 Yeah.
01:41:10.008 It is actual beauty.
01:41:11.898 And it feels good.
01:41:13.509 It's emotional, it'semotional for the inventor,
01:41:16.680 it's emotional for theteam that builds it.
01:41:18.704 It's emotional for the customer.
01:41:20.405 It's a big deal.
01:41:21.450 And you can feel those things.
01:41:23.563 But to keep coming up with that idea,
01:41:26.242 with those kinds of ideas,
01:41:27.525 I guess is the the dayone thinking effort.
01:41:28.985 Yeah, and you need a big group of people
01:41:32.421 who feel that kind of satisfaction
01:41:35.700 with creating that kind of beauty.
01:41:38.189 There's a lot ofbooks written about you.
01:41:41.738 There's a book Invent and Wander
01:41:43.863 where Walter Isaacson does an intro.
01:41:46.086 It's mostly collective writings of yours.
01:41:48.403 I've read that.
01:41:49.622 I also recommend people checkout the Founders Podcast.
01:41:53.105 That covers you a lot andit does different analysis
01:41:56.938 of different business adviceyou've given over the years.
01:41:59.999 I bring all that upbecause I saw that there,
01:42:05.154 I mentioned that you saidthat books are an antidote
01:42:07.736 for short attention spans.
01:42:10.363 And I forget how it was phrased,
01:42:13.180 but that when you werethinking about the Kindle,
01:42:15.320 that you are thinking abouthow technology changes us.
01:42:21.485 Yeah.
01:42:22.318 We co-evolve with our tools.
01:42:26.466 So, you know, we invent new tools
01:42:29.049 and then our tools change us.
01:42:30.901 Which is fascinating to think about.
01:42:32.796 It goes in a circle.
01:42:33.797 And there's some aspect, you know,
01:42:35.623 even just inside business
01:42:37.731 where you don't justmake the customer happy,
01:42:40.305 but you also have to think about like
01:42:41.701 where is this going to take humanity
01:42:44.125 if you zoom out a bit.
01:42:45.367 A hundred percent.
01:42:47.205 And you know, you can feel in your brain,
01:42:53.640 brains are plastic,
01:42:55.166 and you can feel yourbrain getting reprogrammed.
01:42:57.482 I remember the firsttime this happened to me
01:43:00.367 was when Tetris, itfirst came on the scene.
01:43:04.785 I'm sure you've had,
01:43:06.009 anybody who's been a gameplayer has this experience
01:43:09.061 where you close your eyesto lay down to go to sleep
01:43:12.163 and you see all the little blocks moving.
01:43:16.805 And you can, you're kind ofrotating them in your mind
01:43:19.222 and you can just tell asyou walk around the world
01:43:21.927 that you have rewiredyour brain to play Tetris.
01:43:25.944 And, but that happens with everything.
01:43:30.042 And so, you know, oneof the, I think we still
01:43:34.763 have yet to see the fullrepercussions of this, I fear.
01:43:38.088 But I think one of the thingsthat we've done online,
01:43:42.077 you know, and largelybecause of social media
01:43:44.377 is we have trained ourbrains to be really good
01:43:47.863 at processing super short form content.
01:43:51.443 And, you know, your podcastflies in the face of this.
01:43:55.369 You know, you do these long format things
01:43:58.385 and reading books do too.
01:44:00.760 Reading books is a long format thing.
01:44:03.003 And we all do more of if you,
01:44:05.644 if something is convenient,we do more of it.
01:44:09.586 And so when you make tools,
01:44:11.542 you know that we carry around a little,
01:44:15.191 we carry around in our pocket a phone.
01:44:17.845 And one of the things that phone does
01:44:19.811 for the most part is it is anattention shortening device
01:44:23.105 because most of thethings we do on our phone
01:44:25.509 shorten our attention spans.
01:44:27.645 And I'm not even gonna say weknow for sure that that's bad,
01:44:30.701 but I do think it's happening.
01:44:31.959 That's one of the ways we'reco-evolving with that tool.
01:44:34.890 But I think it's importantto spend some of your time
01:44:37.299 and some of your life doinglong attention span things.
01:44:41.702 Yeah, I think you'vespoken about the value
01:44:45.066 in your own life of focus,
01:44:47.720 of singular focus on a thingfor prolonged periods of time.
01:44:50.802 And that's certainly what books do
01:44:52.844 and that's certainly whatthat piece of technology does.
01:44:55.143 But I bring all that up toask you about another piece
01:44:59.485 of technology, AI that has the potential
01:45:03.804 to have a various trajectories
01:45:07.368 to have an impact on human civilization.
01:45:10.445 How do you think AI will change us?
01:45:14.282 You're talking aboutyou know, generative AI,
01:45:17.382 large language models, things like ChatGPT
01:45:20.047 and its soon successors,
01:45:25.009 and these are incrediblypowerful technologies.
01:45:29.782 To believe otherwise is tobury her head in the sand,
01:45:34.048 soon to be even more powerful.
01:45:41.056 It's interesting to me thatthat large language models
01:45:46.024 in their current form are not inventions,
01:45:49.606 they're discoveries.
01:45:52.377 You know, the telescope was an invention,
01:45:55.524 but looking through it at Jupiter,
01:45:59.927 knowing that it had moons was a discovery.
01:46:03.629 My God, it has moons.
01:46:06.626 And that's what Galileo did.
01:46:09.145 And so this is closer onthat spectrum of invention.
01:46:13.209 You know, we know exactlywhat happens with a 787.
01:46:17.063 It's an engineered object.
01:46:19.161 We designed it, we know how it behaves.
01:46:22.026 We don't want any surprises.
01:46:24.970 Large language models aremuch more like discoveries.
01:46:28.743 We're constantly gettingsurprised by their capabilities.
01:46:31.605 They're not really engineered objects.
01:46:35.316 Then you know, you have this debate
01:46:39.587 about whether they'regonna be good for humanity
01:46:41.436 or bad for humanity.
01:46:45.910 You know, even specialized AI
01:46:49.078 could be very bad for humanity.
01:46:51.144 I mean, you know, just regularmachine learning models
01:46:55.886 that can make you know,certain weapons of war
01:47:00.810 that could be incrediblydestructive are very powerful.
01:47:04.562 And they're not general AIs, they're just,
01:47:07.045 they could just be very smart weapons.
01:47:12.207 And so we have to thinkabout all of those things.
01:47:17.494 I'm very optimistic about this.
01:47:20.305 So even in the face ofall this uncertainty,
01:47:24.352 my own view is that these powerful tools
01:47:30.864 are much more likely tohelp us and save us even
01:47:35.105 than they are to unbalance,hurt us, and destroy us.
01:47:39.268 I think you know, we humanshave a lot of ways of,
01:47:42.582 we can make ourselves go extinct.
01:47:44.707 You know, these thingsmay help us not do that.
01:47:47.781 You know, so they may actually save us.
01:47:50.965 So the people who are youknow, overly concerned,
01:47:54.523 in my view, overly concerned.
01:47:55.744 It's a valid debate.
01:47:58.588 I think that they may bemissing part of the equation,
01:48:01.704 which is how helpful they could be
01:48:03.765 in making sure we don't destroy ourselves.
01:48:07.525 I don't know if you sawthe movie Oppenheimer,
01:48:11.247 but to me, first of all, I loved the movie
01:48:15.302 and I thought the best part of the movie
01:48:17.824 is this bureaucrat playedby Robert Downey Jr.
01:48:22.207 who you know, some ofthe people I've talked to
01:48:24.384 think that's the mostboring part of the movie.
01:48:26.022 I thought it was the most fascinating
01:48:28.165 because what's going on here
01:48:31.066 is you realize we have inventedthese awesome, destructive,
01:48:36.432 powerful technologiescalled nuclear weapons
01:48:40.578 and they're managed andyou know, we humans are,
01:48:47.528 we're not really capableof wielding those weapons.
01:48:52.364 We're, you know, that'swhat he represented
01:48:54.979 in that movie is here's this guy
01:48:58.260 who is just, he wrongly thinks,he's like being so petty.
01:49:03.959 He thinks that he said something,
01:49:05.643 that Oppenheimer said somethingbad to Einstein about him.
01:49:08.122 They didn't talk about him at all,
01:49:09.965 as you find out in thefinal scene of the movie.
01:49:12.358 And yet he spent his careertrying to be vengeful
01:49:17.529 and petty.
01:49:19.723 And that's the problem.
01:49:21.209 We as a species are notreally sophisticated enough
01:49:29.504 and mature enough tohandle these technologies.
01:49:32.447 And so, and by the way,before you get to general AI
01:49:36.623 and the possibility of AI having agency
01:49:39.065 and there's a lot of thingswould have to happen,
01:49:41.239 but there's so muchbenefit that's gonna come
01:49:44.365 from these technologies in the meantime,
01:49:46.229 even before they're, you know, general AI
01:49:49.459 in terms of better medicines
01:49:51.872 and better tools to developmore technologies, and so on.
01:49:55.471 I think it's an incrediblemoment to be alive
01:49:59.871 and to witness the transformationsthat are gonna happen.
01:50:02.925 How quickly will happen no one knows.
01:50:04.910 But over the next 10 years and 20 years,
01:50:06.384 I think we're gonna seereally remarkable advances.
01:50:10.285 And I personally am very excited about it.
01:50:12.764 First of all, really interesting to say
01:50:14.366 that it's discoveries that it's true
01:50:18.006 that we don't know thelimits of what's possible
01:50:22.331 with the current language models.
01:50:24.122 We don't.
01:50:24.955 And like it could bea few tricks and hacks
01:50:27.724 here and there that that open doors
01:50:31.131 to whole entire new possibilities.
01:50:33.349 We do know that humans aredoing something different
01:50:37.500 from these models in part because
01:50:42.364 you know, we're so power efficient.
01:50:44.605 You know, the human braindoes remarkable things
01:50:48.169 and it does it on about 20 watts of power.
01:50:51.965 And you know, the AItechniques we use today
01:50:56.072 use many kilowatts of powerto do equivalent tasks.
01:50:59.210 So there's something interesting
01:51:00.650 about the way the human brain does this
01:51:02.722 and also we don't need as much data.
01:51:04.510 So, you know, like self-driving cars are,
01:51:08.109 they have to drive billionsand billions of miles
01:51:11.429 to try to learn how to drive.
01:51:13.484 And you know, your average 16-year-old
01:51:15.112 figures it out with many fewer miles.
01:51:19.983 So there are still some tricks I think
01:51:21.849 that we have yet to learn.
01:51:23.928 I don't think we'velearned the last trick.
01:51:26.429 I don't think it's just aquestion of scaling things up,
01:51:30.268 but what's interesting isthat just scaling things up,
01:51:33.484 and I put just in quotesbecause it's actually hard
01:51:35.149 to scale things up,
01:51:36.170 but just scaling things up also appears
01:51:38.913 to pay huge dividends.
01:51:40.445 Yeah, and there'ssome more nuanced aspect
01:51:43.467 about human beings that's interesting.
01:51:44.913 If it's able to accomplishlike being truly original
01:51:48.947 and novel to you know,large language models,
01:51:51.530 being able to come upwith some truly new ideas.
01:51:55.641 That's one.
01:51:56.474 And the other one is truth.
01:51:59.821 It seems that large languagemodels are very good
01:52:02.811 at sounding like they'resaying a true thing,
01:52:06.977 but they don't requireor often have a grounding
01:52:11.832 in sort of a mathematical truth.
01:52:14.056 It can just, it basicallyis a very good bullshitter.
01:52:17.173 So if there's not enough data,
01:52:19.414 if there's not enough sort of data
01:52:22.212 in the training dataabout a particular topic,
01:52:25.488 it's just going to concoctaccurate sounding narratives,
01:52:30.428 which is a very fascinatingproblem to try to solve.
01:52:35.133 How do you get language models
01:52:37.972 to infer what is true andnot to sort of introspect?
01:52:41.891 Yeah, they need to be taught to say
01:52:43.844 I don't know more often.
01:52:46.035 Yeah.
01:52:47.156 And I know of several humans
01:52:48.810 who could be taught that as well.
01:52:50.633 Sure.
01:52:51.631 And then the other stuff,
01:52:52.932 because you're still a bitinvolved in the Amazon side
01:52:55.476 with the AI things,
01:52:56.829 the other open questionis what kind of products
01:52:59.428 are created from this?
01:53:01.175 Oh, so many.
01:53:02.852 Yeah.
01:53:03.685 I mean, you know, just to,
01:53:05.085 we have Alexa and Echoand Alexa has you know,
01:53:10.463 hundreds of millions ofinstalled base, you know, inputs.
01:53:15.211 And so there's, you know,there's Alexa everywhere
01:53:18.456 and guess what Alexa isabout to get a lot smarter.
01:53:20.755 Yeah.
01:53:21.628 And so that's really you know,
01:53:24.156 from a product point ofview, that's super exciting.
01:53:27.132 There's so many opportunities there.
01:53:28.925 So many opportunities.
01:53:30.252 Shopping assistant, you know,
01:53:32.092 like all that stuff is amazing.
01:53:33.613 And AWS you know, we're building Titan,
01:53:36.515 which is our foundational model.
01:53:38.411 We're also building Bedrock,
01:53:40.972 which our corporate clients atAWS, our enterprise clients,
01:53:47.565 they want to be able touse these powerful models
01:53:49.594 with their own corporate data
01:53:51.753 Without accidentallycontributing their corporate data
01:53:55.875 to that model.
01:53:57.123 And so those are the tools we're building
01:53:59.251 for them with Bedrock.
01:54:00.252 So there's tremendous opportunity here.
01:54:02.834 Yeah, the security, the privacy,
01:54:04.289 all those things arefascinating of how to,
01:54:06.637 'cause so much value can be gained
01:54:08.234 by training on private data
01:54:09.866 that you want to keep the secure.
01:54:11.909 It's a fascinating technical problem.
01:54:13.753 Yes.
01:54:14.586 This is a very challengingtechnical problem
01:54:17.133 and it's one that we're youknow, making progress on
01:54:18.787 and dedicated to solvingfor our customers.
01:54:20.890 Do you think there will be a day
01:54:23.721 when humans and robots maybe Alexa
01:54:25.425 have a romantic relationship?
01:54:27.390 Like in the movie Her.
01:54:29.170 Well, I mean, I think-
01:54:30.884 I'm just brainstorming products here.
01:54:32.380 If you look at thespectrum of human variety
01:54:35.866 and what people like youknow, sexual variety.
01:54:37.884 Yes.
01:54:39.025 You know, there arepeople who like everything.
01:54:41.161 So the answer to yourquestion has to be yes.
01:54:43.056 Okay.
01:54:43.889 I don't know how-
01:54:45.050 I guess I'm asking when?
01:54:46.077 I don't know howwidespread that will be.
01:54:47.120 All right.
01:54:48.123 But it will happen.
01:54:49.039 I was just asking when fora friend, but it's all right.
01:54:53.991 Moving on.
01:54:55.106 Next question.
01:54:56.732 What's a perfectly productiveday in the life of Jeff Bezos?
01:55:01.526 You're one of the mostproductive humans in the world.
01:55:04.507 Well, I first of all,
01:55:05.506 I get up in the morning and I putter.
01:55:07.630 I like have a coffee.
01:55:08.948 Can you define putter?
01:55:11.108 Just like I slowly move around.
01:55:14.382 I'm not as productiveas you might think I am.
01:55:17.725 I mean, 'cause I do believe in wandering
01:55:19.507 and I sort of I, you know,I read my phone for a while.
01:55:23.850 I read newspapers for a while.
01:55:26.648 I chat with Lauren, Idrink my first coffee.
01:55:30.868 So I kind of, I move pretty slowly
01:55:33.365 in the first couple of hours.
01:55:35.227 I get up early just naturally.
01:55:37.883 And then, you know, I exercise most days
01:55:42.669 and most days it's not that hard for me.
01:55:44.747 Some days it's reallyhard and I do it anyway.
01:55:47.389 I don't want to youknow, and it's painful.
01:55:49.264 And I'm like why am Ihere and I don't want to.
01:55:51.935 Why am I here at the gym?
01:55:53.260 Why am I here at the gym?
01:55:54.430 Why don't I do something else?
01:55:56.683 You know, it's not always easy.
01:55:59.161 What's your socialmotivation in those moments?
01:56:02.404 I know that I'll feelbetter later if I do it.
01:56:05.727 And so like the real source of motivation,
01:56:08.845 I can tell the days when I skip it,
01:56:11.324 I'm not quite as alert.
01:56:12.798 I don't feel as good.
01:56:14.797 And then there's harder motivations.
01:56:17.417 It's longer term, you wantto be healthy as you age,
01:56:19.880 you know, you want healthspan, you want, ideally,
01:56:23.855 you know, you want to behealthy and moving around
01:56:26.157 when you're 80 years old, you know,
01:56:27.867 and so there's a lot of,
01:56:29.870 but that kind of motivationis so far in the future.
01:56:33.285 It can be very hard to work in the second.
01:56:35.866 So thinking about thefact I'll feel better
01:56:38.348 in about four hours if I do it now.
01:56:39.791 I'll have more energyfor the rest of my day
01:56:41.503 and so on and so on.
01:56:42.702 What's your exercise routine?
01:56:44.345 Just to linger on that.
01:56:45.343 How much do you curl?
01:56:46.542 I mean, what are we talking about here?
01:56:49.790 That's all I do at the gym.
01:56:50.965 So I just-
01:56:51.798 My routine, you know, on a good day,
01:56:55.762 I do about half an hour of cardio
01:56:58.575 and I do about 45minutes of weightlifting,
01:57:01.610 resistance training ofsome kind, mostly weights.
01:57:04.598 I have a trainer who you know, I love
01:57:08.250 who pushes me, which is really helpful.
01:57:11.474 You know, I'll be like,
01:57:13.395 he'll say Jeff, you think you could,
01:57:17.093 can we go up on that weight a little bit?
01:57:18.597 And I'll think about it?
01:57:21.258 And I'll be like no, I don't think so.
01:57:23.557 And he'll look at me andsay yeah, I think you can.
01:57:30.243 And of course he's right.
01:57:31.699 Yeah, of course, of course.
01:57:32.993 So it's cool to havesomebody push you a little bit.
01:57:34.941 But almost every day you do that?
01:57:37.257 I do, almost every day.I do a little bit of cardio
01:57:40.659 and a little bit of weightlifting
01:57:42.563 and I rotate.
01:57:44.336 I do a pulling day and apushing day and a leg day.
01:57:46.884 It's all pretty standard stuff.
01:57:48.336 So puttering, coffee, gym.
01:57:49.842 Puttering, coffee, gym, and then work.
01:57:52.864 Work.
01:57:53.697 What's work look like?
01:57:54.728 What are the productivehours look like for you?
01:57:58.352 I, you know, so a couple years ago
01:58:00.935 I left as the CEO of Amazon.
01:58:03.274 And I have never worked harder in my life.
01:58:08.596 I am working so hard andI'm mostly enjoying it.
01:58:11.825 But there are also some very painful days.
01:58:14.443 Most of my time is spent on Blue Origin
01:58:18.855 and I've been, I'm sodeeply involved here now
01:58:21.551 for the last couple of years.
01:58:23.192 And in the big, I love it
01:58:24.428 and the small, there'sall the frustrations
01:58:26.419 that come along with everything.
01:58:27.973 You know, we're trying toget to rate manufacturing
01:58:30.055 as we talked about.
01:58:31.059 That's super important.
01:58:32.813 We'll get there.
01:58:33.709 We just hired a new CEO,
01:58:35.458 a guy I've known forclose to 15 years now,
01:58:37.390 a guy named Dave Limp, who I love.
01:58:39.138 He's amazing.
01:58:40.159 You know, so we'resuper lucky to have Dave
01:58:43.816 and you know, we're going to,
01:58:45.735 you're gonna see us move faster there.
01:58:47.401 But, so my day of work, youknow, reading documents,
01:58:51.334 having meetings, sometimes inperson, sometimes over Zoom,
01:58:55.434 depends on where I am.
01:58:56.837 It's all about you know, the technology.
01:58:59.919 It's about the organization.
01:59:01.138 It's about you know, I'm very,
01:59:04.707 I have architectureand technology meetings
01:59:08.778 almost every day on varioussubsystems inside the vehicle,
01:59:13.456 inside the engines.
01:59:14.937 It's super fun for me.
01:59:16.475 My favorite part of it is the technology.
01:59:19.169 My least favorite part of it is
01:59:23.279 you know, buildingorganizations and so on.
01:59:25.516 That's important, but it'salso my least favorite part.
01:59:28.339 So, you know, that'swhy they call it work.
01:59:30.230 You don't always get todo what you wanna do.
01:59:31.696 How do you achievetime where you can focus
01:59:34.581 and truly think through problems?
01:59:36.277 I do little thinking retreats.
01:59:38.900 So for, this is not the only,
01:59:41.199 I can do that all day long.
01:59:42.696 I'm very good at focusing.
01:59:44.320 I'm very good at you know,
01:59:47.706 I don't keep to a strict schedule.
01:59:50.214 Like my meetings oftengo longer than I plan
01:59:53.012 for them to because Ibelieve in wandering,
01:59:55.715 My perfect meeting startswith a crisp document.
01:59:59.478 So the document should bewritten with such clarity
02:00:02.480 that it's like angelssinging from on high.
02:00:04.958 I like a crisp documentand a messy meeting.
02:00:08.215 And so the meeting isabout like asking questions
02:00:13.097 that nobody knows the answer to
02:00:14.409 and trying to like wanderyour way to a solution.
02:00:20.417 And because like whenthat happens just right,
02:00:27.467 it makes all the othermeetings worthwhile.
02:00:29.499 It feels good.
02:00:30.545 It has a kind of beauty to it.
02:00:32.028 It has an aesthetic beauty to it.
02:00:34.501 And you get real breakthroughsin meetings like that.
02:00:37.233 Can you actually describethe crisp document?
02:00:39.708 Like this is one of thelegendary aspects of Amazon,
02:00:42.771 of the way you approach meetings?
02:00:44.953 Is this the six page memo?
02:00:47.734 Maybe first describe the process
02:00:50.151 of running a meeting with memos.
02:00:51.495 Meetings at Amazon andat Blue Origin are unusual.
02:00:55.611 When we get new,
02:00:57.794 when new people come in,like a new executive joins,
02:01:00.696 they're a little taken aback sometimes
02:01:02.868 because a typical meeting,
02:01:05.128 we'll start with a six pagenarratively structured memo
02:01:09.050 and we do study hall.
02:01:11.656 For 30 minutes, we sitthere silently together
02:01:14.936 in the meeting and read.
02:01:16.875 I love this.
02:01:17.873 Take notes in the margins.
02:01:19.475 And then we discuss.
02:01:22.395 And the reason, by the way we do study,
02:01:25.788 you could say I would likeeverybody to read these memos
02:01:27.475 in advance, but the problemis people don't have time
02:01:31.503 to do that.
02:01:32.501 And they end up coming to the meeting
02:01:34.272 having only skimmed the memoor maybe not read it at all.
02:01:37.291 And they're trying to catch up.
02:01:38.810 And they're also bluffinglike they were in college
02:01:41.145 having pretended to do the reading.
02:01:42.268 Yeah,
02:01:43.101 Exactly.
02:01:44.224 It's better just to carveout the time for people
02:01:46.268 And do it together.
02:01:47.149 So now we're all on the same page.
02:01:48.551 We've all read the memo
02:01:50.234 and now we can have areally elevated discussion.
02:01:53.327 And this is so much better
02:01:54.915 from having a slideshowpresentation, you know,
02:01:57.736 a PowerPoint presentation of some kind
02:02:00.130 where that has so many difficulties.
02:02:02.713 But one of the problems is PowerPoint
02:02:04.557 is really designed to persuade.
02:02:05.851 It's kind of a sales tool.
02:02:07.814 And internally the lastthing you want to do is sell.
02:02:12.115 You want to, you're again,you're truth seeking.
02:02:13.942 You're trying to find truth.
02:02:15.987 And the other problem with PowerPoint
02:02:17.722 is it's easy for the authorand hard for the audience.
02:02:22.072 And a memo is the opposite.
02:02:24.114 It's hard to write a six page memo.
02:02:25.960 A good six page memo mighttake two weeks to write.
02:02:28.804 You have to write it,you have to rewrite it,
02:02:30.798 you have to edit it, you haveto talk to people about it.
02:02:33.068 They have to poke holes in it for you.
02:02:35.048 You write it again, itmight take two weeks.
02:02:37.789 So the author, it's reallya very difficult job,
02:02:41.453 but for the audience it's much better.
02:02:45.337 So you can read a half hour and you know,
02:02:47.653 there are little problems withPowerPoint presentations too.
02:02:50.672 You know, senior executivesinterrupt with questions
02:02:52.590 halfway through the presentation.
02:02:54.393 That question's gonna beanswered on the next slide,
02:02:56.430 but you never got there.
02:02:58.031 If you read the whole memo in advance,
02:03:00.372 you know, I often write lots of questions
02:03:01.904 that I have in the margins of these memos,
02:03:05.370 and then I go cross them all out
02:03:06.812 because by the time I getto the end of the memo,
02:03:08.673 they've been answered.
02:03:09.973 That's why I save all that time.
02:03:11.993 You also get, you know,
02:03:13.529 if the person who's preparing the memo,
02:03:15.516 we talked earlier aboutyou know, group think
02:03:19.894 and you know, the factthat I go last in meetings
02:03:22.971 and that you don't wantyou know, your ideas
02:03:26.216 to kind of pollute themeeting prematurely.
02:03:29.792 You know, the author of the memos
02:03:32.428 has kind of got to be very vulnerable.
02:03:35.515 They've gotta put alltheir thoughts out there.
02:03:37.711 And they've got to go first.
02:03:39.527 But that's great 'causeit makes 'em really good.
02:03:42.925 And so, and you get tosee their real ideas
02:03:45.436 and you're not trampling onthem accidentally in a big,
02:03:48.774 you know, PowerPoint presentation.
02:03:50.587 What's that feel likewhen you've authored a thing
02:03:52.692 and then you're sitting there
02:03:53.836 and everybody's reading your thing,
02:03:55.174 you're like-
02:03:56.094 I think it's mostly terrifying.
02:03:57.566 Yeah.
02:04:00.246 Like maybe in a good way?
02:04:02.210 I think it's-
02:04:03.275 Like purifying.
02:04:04.511 I think it's terrifyingin a productive way.
02:04:08.209 Yeah.
02:04:09.042 But I think it's emotionally
02:04:10.473 a very nerve wracking experience.
02:04:13.114 Is there a art science to the writing
02:04:16.795 of the six page memo or justwriting in general to you?
02:04:20.005 I mean, it's reallygot to be a real memo.
02:04:23.897 So it means you know,paragraphs have topic sentences,
02:04:28.609 like it's verbs and nouns.
02:04:30.167 You can't, that's the otherproblem with PowerPoints,
02:04:31.986 they're often just bullet points
02:04:33.766 and you can hide a lot of sloppy thinking
02:04:36.874 behind bullet points.
02:04:38.157 When you have to writein complete sentences
02:04:40.055 with narrative structure,
02:04:41.292 it's really hard to hide sloppy thinking.
02:04:43.688 So it does, it forces theauthor to be at their best.
02:04:48.392 And so you're getting somebody's,
02:04:50.391 they're getting somebody'sreally their best thinking.
02:04:53.291 And then you don't haveto spend a lot of time
02:04:55.645 trying to tease thatthinking out of the person.
02:04:59.014 And you've got it from the very beginning.
02:05:00.825 So it really saves youtime in the long run.
02:05:03.037 So that part is crispand then the rest is messy,
02:05:06.349 crisp document.
02:05:07.182 Yeah, so you don't wanna pretend
02:05:09.614 that the discussion should be crisp.
02:05:11.777 There's, you know, most meetings,
02:05:13.335 you're trying to solvea really hard problem.
02:05:15.989 There's a different kind of meeting,
02:05:17.471 which we call weekly business reviews
02:05:19.024 or business reviews thatmay be weekly or monthly
02:05:21.286 or daily, whatever they are.
02:05:22.549 But these business review meetings,
02:05:24.492 that's usually forincremental improvement.
02:05:27.209 And you're like lookingat a series of metrics,
02:05:28.811 every time it's the same metrics.
02:05:30.817 Those meetings can be very efficient.
02:05:32.718 They can start on time and end on time.
02:05:35.214 So we're about to run out of time,
02:05:37.292 which is a good time to askabout the 10,000 year clock.
02:05:44.166 That's what I'm known for, is the humor.
02:05:48.150 Okay.
02:05:49.909 Can you explain what the10,000 year clock is?
02:05:52.545 10,000 year clock is a physicalclock of monumental scale.
02:05:56.652 It's about 500 feet tall.
02:05:58.090 It's inside a mountain in west Texas
02:06:00.710 in a chamber that'sabout 12 feet in diameter
02:06:03.325 and 500 feet tall.
02:06:04.831 10,000 year clock is a idea conceived
02:06:07.931 by brilliant guy named Danny Hillis
02:06:10.271 way back in the '80s.
02:06:13.464 The idea is to build a clock as a symbol
02:06:15.829 for long-term thinking.
02:06:17.681 And you can kind of justvery conceptually think
02:06:21.312 of the 10,000 year clock as it you know,
02:06:24.574 it ticks once a year.
02:06:27.012 It chimes once you know,every a hundred years.
02:06:31.035 And the cuckoo comes outonce every a thousand years.
02:06:33.850 So it just sort of slows everything down.
02:06:36.476 And it's a completely mechanical clock.
02:06:40.453 It is designed to last 10,000 years
02:06:43.574 with no human intervention.
02:06:45.312 So the material choicesand everything else.
02:06:48.514 It's in a remote location,both to protect it,
02:06:51.692 but also so that visitors haveto kind of make a pilgrimage.
02:06:57.152 The idea is that over time,
02:07:00.652 this will take hundreds of years,
02:07:02.753 but over time it willtake on the patina of age
02:07:06.573 and then it will become asymbol for long-term thinking
02:07:11.055 that will actually, hopefully get humans
02:07:14.433 to extend their thinking horizons.
02:07:18.433 And my view that's reallyimportant as we have become,
02:07:23.930 as a species, as acivilization more powerful,
02:07:26.711 you know, we're reallyaffecting the planet now.
02:07:29.096 We're really affecting each other.
02:07:30.567 We have weapons of mass destruction,
02:07:32.972 we have all kinds of things
02:07:35.560 where we can really hurt ourselves.
02:07:37.833 And the problems wecreate can be so large.
02:07:40.933 You know, the unintended consequences
02:07:43.909 of some of our actionslike climate change,
02:07:45.840 putting carbon in theatmosphere is a perfect example.
02:07:47.703 That's an unintended consequence
02:07:49.127 of the industrial revolutionthat a lot of benefits from it.
02:07:52.323 But we've also got this side effect
02:07:55.107 that is very detrimental.
02:07:56.676 We need to be, we need tostart training ourselves
02:08:00.100 to think longer term.
02:08:01.104 Long-term thinking is a giant lever.
02:08:02.300 You can literally solve problems
02:08:05.162 if you think long-term
02:08:06.476 that are impossible to solveif you think short term.
02:08:09.063 And we aren't really goodat thinking long-term
02:08:11.664 as you know, it's not really,
02:08:13.215 we're kind of, you know, fiveyears is a tough timeframe
02:08:18.222 for most institutions to think past.
02:08:22.921 And we probably need tostretch that to 10 years
02:08:25.120 and 15 years and 20 years and 25 years.
02:08:27.717 And we do a better job for our children
02:08:29.816 or our grandchildren if we could stretch
02:08:32.364 those thinking horizons.
02:08:34.536 And so the clock is, in away, it's an art project,
02:08:38.643 it's a symbol.
02:08:40.479 And if it ever has anypower to influence people
02:08:44.270 to think longer term,
02:08:45.722 that won't happen for hundreds of years.
02:08:47.521 But we have to, you know,we're gonna build it now
02:08:50.122 and let it accrue the patina of age.
02:08:52.223 Do you think humans will be here
02:08:53.680 when the clock runs out?
02:08:55.139 Here on earth?
02:08:56.461 I think so.
02:08:59.462 But you know, the UnitedStates won't exist.
02:09:01.955 Like whole civilizations rise and fall.
02:09:03.817 10,000 years is so long.
02:09:06.716 Like no nation state has ever survived
02:09:10.143 for anywhere close to 10,000 years.
02:09:12.760 And the increasing rate of progress
02:09:14.561 makes that even-
02:09:15.577 Even less likely so.
02:09:16.581 Do I think humans will be here?
02:09:18.071 Yes.
02:09:18.949 What, you know, how willwe have changed ourselves
02:09:21.439 and what will we be and so on and so on.
02:09:23.239 I don't know, but I think we'll be here.
02:09:25.724 On that grand scale,a human life feels tiny.
02:09:28.620 Do you ponder your own mortality?
02:09:31.132 Are you afraid of death?
02:09:32.499 No, I'm you know, I usedto be afraid of death.
02:09:36.380 I did.
02:09:37.213 I like I remember as a young person
02:09:40.625 being kind of like veryscared of mortality,
02:09:45.263 like didn't want tothink about it and so on.
02:09:47.881 And always had a big, and asI've gotten older, I'm 59 now.
02:09:51.673 As I've gotten older, somehow that fear
02:09:55.216 has sort of gone away.
02:09:58.400 I don't, you know, Iwould like to stay alive
02:10:01.302 for as long as possible,but I'd like to be,
02:10:02.899 I'm really more focused on health span.
02:10:05.163 I want to be healthy.
02:10:06.945 I want that square wave.
02:10:08.321 I want to you know,
02:10:09.783 this I wanna be healthy,healthy, healthy, and then gone.
02:10:12.169 I don't want the long decay.
02:10:15.286 And I'm curious, I wannasee how things turn out.
02:10:18.941 You know, I'd like to be here.
02:10:21.080 I love my family and my close friends
02:10:23.425 and I want to,
02:10:24.418 I'm curious about them and I wanna see,
02:10:25.521 so I have a lot of reasons to stay around,
02:10:28.283 but it's mortality doesn'thave have that effect
02:10:34.478 on me that it did you know,maybe when I was in my 20s.
02:10:37.984 Well Jeff, thank youfor creating Amazon,

02:10:46.541 and multi-planetary species expanding out
02:10:48.977 into our solar system, maybe beyond,
02:10:51.908 to meet the aliens out there.
02:10:53.919 And thank you for talking today.
02:10:55.957 Well, Lex, thank you for doing your part
