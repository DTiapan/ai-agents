00:00:00.240 okay so in this video I'm going to be
00:00:01.680 breaking down the simplest AI offer that
00:00:03.840 you can make to businesses in order to
00:00:05.400 get in the game get a foot in the door
00:00:07.520 start getting a bit of experience
00:00:08.800 getting on client calls start actually
00:00:10.679 delivering something and getting into
00:00:12.360 the game of selling things to businesses
00:00:14.440 um that doesn't require you to have a
00:00:16.160 huge development team or extensive
00:00:18.320 development experience or even
00:00:20.640 experience getting on calls or knowing
00:00:22.240 how to generate leads this really is the
00:00:23.760 smallest little baby step offer that you
00:00:25.519 can make in order to just start making
00:00:27.760 some progress towards your end goal of
00:00:29.519 being a successful AI automation agency
00:00:31.720 owner or AI entrepreneur so this video
00:00:33.640 is really intended for beginners who are
00:00:35.040 trying to get into the game but I just
00:00:36.840 feel like they have no clue what they
00:00:38.320 should offer they don't really know how
00:00:39.559 to do market research they're having
00:00:41.039 trouble generating leads and knowing
00:00:42.280 what they should Niche down to so if you
00:00:44.280 are one of these people completely new
00:00:45.600 to the game this is going to solve a lot
00:00:47.680 of your problems and answer some key
00:00:49.440 questions for you so first thing you
00:00:51.320 need to understand about this let's put
00:00:53.000 up here simple
00:00:55.680 simp list AI offer
00:01:01.920 so you need first thing you need to
00:01:03.920 understand is the concept of a knowledge
00:01:05.438 gap which is how we make money in the AI
00:01:08.320 space generally or in any industry
00:01:11.040 whatsoever if it's a service based
00:01:12.400 industry particularly so if you take say
00:01:14.439 smma and digital marketing smas social
00:01:17.560 media marketing agencies make money
00:01:19.520 because the owners and the team at the
00:01:21.560 smma has a knowledge Gap that the
00:01:24.040 between themselves and the businesses
00:01:25.360 basically they know more about digital
00:01:27.040 marketing and how to get results with it
00:01:29.119 than the business owners do so the
00:01:30.400 business owners pay them to get that
00:01:33.000 they pay them the difference of that
00:01:34.119 knowledge Gap basically so let's start
00:01:36.119 off with key concept of knowledge
00:01:40.119 Gap this is going to make sense sense
00:01:42.200 for a second and I will be giving you
00:01:43.399 this shortly I'm not going to drag it
00:01:44.640 out forever um knowledge Gap so
00:01:48.920 basically
00:01:52.079 um so here's the Continuum of all
00:01:55.079 knowledge um so here's using example
00:01:57.960 here's the business owner all right
00:01:59.439 let's start this this is zero so this is
00:02:01.960 zero this is maybe 10 this is maybe a a
00:02:06.159 65 and this is a 100 so on this
00:02:09.720 knowledge scale say these people are
00:02:11.239 just the this is the best person in the
00:02:12.840 world this is the best agency or the
00:02:14.120 best team the absolute best knowledge
00:02:17.160 and you could say or in this case is
00:02:19.040 going to be AI as to the expertise
00:02:21.760 available so they are really really
00:02:24.200 worth a lot and they they are just own
00:02:26.720 the market running everything because
00:02:28.120 they know so much but they're obviously
00:02:29.360 going to be very expensive because they
00:02:31.160 have so much context and understand it
00:02:33.319 now if the business owner is
00:02:35.959 here say how do I draw a uh brought a
00:02:41.480 business what the far going out so this
00:02:44.080 is the
00:02:45.879 business and this is say an
00:02:50.239 agency a AAA
00:02:52.959 agency this 65 represents the knowledge
00:02:55.879 that maybe the average one has or or a a
00:02:58.120 one that's sort of doing well initially
00:03:00.280 yet to sort of scale into later ends of
00:03:02.080 running an agency successfully um but
00:03:04.360 basically businesses will come to this
00:03:05.959 agency and they'll like hey I need help
00:03:08.200 with this AI thing I don't know anything
00:03:10.239 really about the technology I don't know
00:03:12.360 uh what what use case is the best for my
00:03:14.200 business and I'm really just stuck and I
00:03:15.799 want some help and I'm also going to
00:03:17.360 need your expertise to help me implement
00:03:18.920 this without dozens and dozens of issues
00:03:20.879 I trying to do it myself
00:03:22.959 so this is how this Gap here is where
00:03:28.280 this agency is going to make their money
00:03:30.200 because they have a knowledge gap
00:03:32.000 between where what the business knows
00:03:33.360 about Ai and what they know about Ai and
00:03:35.599 also their capabilities when it comes to
00:03:37.080 the D team and stuff now most of you
00:03:40.599 starting off when you are getting into
00:03:42.120 AI say let's let's say the average
00:03:43.760 business owner average is about a 10 on
00:03:46.040 this most people are try to jump all the
00:03:48.760 way to this point here and be a a fully
00:03:51.120 fledged agency and and sell every a
00:03:53.959 whole nine yards when in reality um or
00:03:57.000 or they think they need to be there
00:03:58.079 immediately until they don't get started
00:03:59.599 with the business or they think oh it's
00:04:00.879 not for me in reality you can
00:04:04.319 be at maybe 25 here and have
00:04:08.519 you with your little agency or just just
00:04:11.159 yourself but you know more than that
00:04:13.200 business and you can still make money in
00:04:16.478 this Gap the question is how and what is
00:04:19.040 the offer and that's what I'm going to
00:04:20.279 reval to in a second so this is very key
00:04:22.000 concept to anything this is why you
00:04:24.759 should always be try to expand either
00:04:26.120 your knowledge and this Gap does
00:04:27.840 represent your team as well so uh I talk
00:04:30.120 a lot about it in my uh in my program
00:04:32.039 but this knowledge Gap can be expanded
00:04:33.560 through your team it's it's kind of the
00:04:35.080 combined of either your brain and then
00:04:36.680 also all of the team that you have with
00:04:38.400 it so when you make a new hire suddenly
00:04:40.520 you can jump from 25 to 35 because you
00:04:42.960 brought on a really good AI developer
00:04:44.680 who significantly moves increases the
00:04:46.720 knowledge Gap this can also count factor
00:04:48.919 in things like experience and things
00:04:50.680 you've done before that allows you to be
00:04:52.600 more valuable to them because you've
00:04:54.120 done done the same thing before and
00:04:55.840 you're going to get less issues when you
00:04:56.960 do it
00:04:58.320 so step one
00:05:00.199 understanding that knowledge Gap I do
00:05:01.440 have a pretty miserable rasor here sorry
00:05:05.600 so you give me a second so you
00:05:07.720 understand what knowledge Gap is Tick
00:05:10.199 Tick now question is when you have such
00:05:12.840 a small knowledge Gap or even
00:05:14.000 nonexistent maybe you just found my
00:05:15.720 video or found the space as a whole and
00:05:17.680 like wow I want to get into this but I'm
00:05:19.240 at I I'm like either behind where the
00:05:21.440 average business owner is or I'm about
00:05:23.240 with this where they are at the moment I
00:05:24.600 kind of have a a basic knowledge of it
00:05:26.560 as well so what you need to be looking
00:05:29.039 at is how you can increase that
00:05:30.479 knowledge Gap and then make an offer
00:05:32.360 that allows you to sell back down that
00:05:34.039 and profit from that Gap all right so
00:05:35.919 I'm going to introduce you to this
00:05:37.840 concept of um AI
00:05:41.240 tools
00:05:45.360 Consulting now what is this this is
00:05:48.039 basically the most basic and simple
00:05:50.319 thing that I could possibly come up with
00:05:51.800 before getting into the space where you
00:05:53.759 are essentially a consultant that helps
00:05:55.600 business owners to identify the best AI
00:05:58.360 tools to use in your existing processes
00:06:00.319 and and for their for their team
00:06:01.840 currently now the reason this is so
00:06:03.840 great is because it skips the entire
00:06:05.520 step of having to do implementation and
00:06:07.120 owner development team because it's kind
00:06:08.599 of like you're just uh you're
00:06:12.400 selling
00:06:14.199 other
00:06:17.080 people's
00:06:18.800 stuff which as a general rule of thumb
00:06:21.199 when you're starting businesses or
00:06:22.560 getting started with running a business
00:06:24.360 or you want to make money on life the
00:06:26.120 easiest way to do it and this is
00:06:27.880 something I I wish I could sort of learn
00:06:29.560 ear in my journey is it's easy to sell
00:06:32.120 other people's stuff um where they've
00:06:34.080 already got a clearly defined marketing
00:06:36.080 process or they've got a a really great
00:06:37.840 product that they spent a lot of money
00:06:39.039 on or the service is really good and
00:06:40.639 there's a killer off that comes with it
00:06:42.400 it's easy to sell other people's stuff
00:06:43.919 where they have done all the hard work
00:06:45.080 on the product with the service than to
00:06:46.840 try and do it all yourself so when I
00:06:48.120 first started my very first online
00:06:49.759 business um through e-commerce and Drop
00:06:51.360 Shipping sure I was selling someone
00:06:52.960 else's product but I was still doing the
00:06:55.400 entire business thing myself and when
00:06:57.160 you come from absolutely zero on the
00:06:59.240 Entre rur scale trying to jump from
00:07:01.560 there to running a whole business and
00:07:03.039 having having a team that you got to
00:07:04.479 manage managing suppliers uh managing
00:07:06.960 finances and stuff like this it's a lot
00:07:08.400 to lot to pick up early on um but if you
00:07:11.240 are say fitting in as a salesperson
00:07:13.520 you're selling someone else's product in
00:07:14.960 the framework of their business and
00:07:16.520 they've already got everything dialed
00:07:17.759 and theyve done all the hard work and
00:07:19.240 you get to come along and sell their
00:07:20.360 products and make money so that is
00:07:22.080 something that that as sort of a side
00:07:23.759 note um is a is a good practice and in
00:07:26.400 this case we're kind of stealing from
00:07:27.960 from that idea we're basically selling
00:07:29.599 other people's tools or selling other
00:07:31.479 people's products without having to
00:07:33.160 First Bard them ourselves so I've talked
00:07:35.560 recently in my video about the new kind
00:07:36.879 of AI agency model that's going to got
00:07:38.960 to really surge this year um and Me
00:07:41.199 Myself and the team at morning side and
00:07:43.400 Peep Lurch um I've been wearing this a
00:07:45.599 lot I don't know why I wasn't RAR this
00:07:46.680 in videos more but um yeah we've all
00:07:48.520 been rank it into the office so I'll
00:07:50.319 just come back and uh here we are so um
00:07:54.440 I'll do a bit more of a spectrum thing
00:07:56.680 again and that will also help break this
00:07:59.080 down for you
00:07:59.960 so on the furthest end of the spectrum
00:08:01.560 here in terms of like
00:08:04.960 difficulty we have
00:08:10.759 implementation by this I mean AI Dev
00:08:15.800 Services svca Services uh
00:08:21.400 implmentation implementation and then we
00:08:24.159 have on this side I don't know which one
00:08:27.520 you put in front of the other I probably
00:08:29.759 would go actually yeah Education
00:08:34.320 First cuz I mean any of you can watch a
00:08:36.640 whole bunch of YouTube videos kind of
00:08:38.000 compile together use AI to help you
00:08:39.799 write a nice script or make it into some
00:08:42.159 some presentation um and then the sort
00:08:45.320 of Middle Point here I'd probably
00:08:46.839 actually put it sort of more to that
00:08:48.360 side is uh
00:08:52.600 consulting which is what you're doing
00:08:54.360 here and this is kind of how I started
00:08:55.839 off I I guess both these when I started
00:08:57.720 my journey I was making YouTube videos
00:08:59.440 and then I was selling Consulting
00:09:00.560 through my YouTube channel and saying
00:09:01.680 hey if you want to learn more about this
00:09:02.880 AI chatot I just built you can book a
00:09:04.680 call with me down below and that was my
00:09:06.040 original way I monetized my my skills in
00:09:08.399 the AI space and allow me to build a lot
00:09:10.160 of confidence on my uh on my uh the
00:09:12.680 Consulting CES I did um and that allowed
00:09:15.399 me to eventually get down to the
00:09:16.839 implementations they providing my own AI
00:09:19.120 automation agency Morningside AI now the
00:09:21.360 reason I'm telling you this is because
00:09:24.160 um you don't need to unless you really
00:09:26.480 really have either the resources or you
00:09:28.120 want to go all out and and really learn
00:09:29.920 these tools um by tools I mean the the
00:09:33.160 service delivery platforms like Forest
00:09:34.560 flow agenda of make um relevant AI all
00:09:37.760 these VY all these kind of Service
00:09:39.800 delivery platforms for AI agencies this
00:09:42.519 is is obviously the skills here are much
00:09:44.800 better and much more valuable but if
00:09:46.600 you're just all going to get started
00:09:48.279 then these are also options for you but
00:09:50.959 if you're a developer I'd highly
00:09:52.240 recommend that you do swing that way
00:09:53.760 first because it uses your skills but
00:09:55.279 some people are just starting with
00:09:56.320 absolutely nothing so this is a good
00:09:58.200 place to start to just get familiar with
00:10:00.120 the process of AI freelancing and and
00:10:02.320 running your own business so education
00:10:04.519 we're not really going to focus on that
00:10:05.519 in this video but what this offers is
00:10:07.360 essentially a Consulting offer where and
00:10:09.600 I'm going to give you the process on the
00:10:11.120 syum you are doing these AI tool
00:10:13.600 consults for free initially I'd
00:10:15.480 recommend for businesses and you could
00:10:17.200 you can just continue doing them for
00:10:18.360 free as a lead magnet as we're going to
00:10:19.800 go going to go into it a second but this
00:10:22.480 is so that you don't have to jump
00:10:24.800 immediately to this where either you are
00:10:27.480 deving the stuff yourself and in that
00:10:29.120 case need to spend maybe uh not not
00:10:31.560 maybe you definitely need to spend a few
00:10:32.920 months of of learning and spending and
00:10:35.399 spending time consistently practicing
00:10:37.399 and and following tutorials and
00:10:38.800 consuming content on YouTube about the
00:10:40.440 the best use cases and how to build them
00:10:41.959 and then getting to a stage where you're
00:10:43.160 actually able to pitch businesses and
00:10:45.160 you do all the lead generation stuff as
00:10:46.440 well so there's quite a lot to that and
00:10:47.800 this is definitely a great starting
00:10:49.000 point for people with either business
00:10:50.560 backgrounds and they can hire for
00:10:52.279 developers immediately or for developers
00:10:54.720 who can start doing it themselves but
00:10:56.079 some of you with no business experience
00:10:57.920 and even no technical experience as well
00:10:59.880 this is a better place to start um so
00:11:01.959 let me just rub this off um actually I
00:11:04.839 can just jump straight into it so
00:11:05.920 basically the AI tools Consulting
00:11:08.040 process is is pretty straightforward um
00:11:11.000 what I would recommend you do is firstly
00:11:13.240 create that knowledge Gap right so even
00:11:14.680 if you were starting at zero on that
00:11:16.800 scale I drew before you can
00:11:26.279 um you can't number one find
00:11:32.279 tools and I'll explain how you monetize
00:11:34.560 this in a second so just just stick with
00:11:36.120 me um it's actually pretty pretty nifty
00:11:39.240 and also how you get clients I'm going
00:11:40.600 to touch on that briefly here as well um
00:11:43.079 doesn't need to be something crazy uh
00:11:45.079 but F tools this means you're going to
00:11:46.880 be going on things like
00:11:49.040 YouTube and thankfully there's people
00:11:51.560 like myself and others I mean I think by
00:11:54.760 the time this video goes out I will have
00:11:56.160 just posted one about AI tools that I
00:11:58.079 use in my business so uh to make quite a
00:12:00.639 lot of money as well so I'll put these
00:12:02.279 things up here um it'll be up there and
00:12:05.120 maybe in the description as well my
00:12:06.880 recent AI tools video that I did um but
00:12:09.839 you can watch a bunch of YouTube videos
00:12:11.240 to find the best tools I mean there's
00:12:12.519 always these videos about I tried a
00:12:14.320 bajillion AI tools and these are the
00:12:16.240 best ones so I mean if these guys are
00:12:18.920 really they're not lying they've done a
00:12:21.199 lot of other hard work for you um and
00:12:23.040 you can find some great tools watching
00:12:24.240 these videos now my process that I'd
00:12:26.160 recommend is that you watch you find
00:12:27.720 these tools by YouTube videos it's
00:12:29.560 probably going to be the best way to do
00:12:30.800 it um and then you go um and make a
00:12:37.880 list i' to go put these on a a Google
00:12:40.720 sheet or
00:12:41.760 something and just put a whole bunch of
00:12:44.000 links in names and everything and do a
00:12:46.079 little bit of categorization even you
00:12:47.519 can say hey this is a creative thing or
00:12:49.560 an AI image generator or video generator
00:12:52.279 Etc and then
00:12:54.800 thirdly I would Deep dive
00:13:00.639 so that means on each of these actually
00:13:02.800 I wouldn't do each of them I would make
00:13:04.079 sure that this list you kind of narrow
00:13:05.639 it down to a short list of the best ones
00:13:07.800 based off what these guys in these
00:13:09.000 videos are talking about um you maybe
00:13:10.959 pick a bunch in a couple different
00:13:12.199 categories like okay these seemingly the
00:13:14.079 best image generators the best video
00:13:15.839 generators Etc the best writing tools
00:13:18.560 and then you start to you make a short
00:13:20.279 list that you're going to do a deep dive
00:13:21.519 on now deep diving means I would then go
00:13:24.639 and go uh YouTube search
00:13:27.880 again and but specifically for that tool
00:13:30.920 so I would be saying okay let's find say
00:13:34.120 it was Runway and you search up Runway
00:13:35.880 AI tutorial and you start to go through
00:13:37.839 it and watch you see what people are
00:13:39.040 doing with it and you see best Runway AI
00:13:41.240 use cases or best video Generation Um
00:13:44.800 best AI video generation use cases and
00:13:47.680 you find them either on uh YouTube is a
00:13:49.600 great place to do it but some of these
00:13:51.040 tools are so new and so obscure that you
00:13:52.680 won't even find much you might need to
00:13:54.199 go to Google Search even basically do a
00:13:56.320 deep dive and see if anyone has has
00:13:57.920 revealed some cool stuff can do with
00:13:59.519 this just to build up the context that
00:14:00.839 you have on it and then I would also go
00:14:03.360 and try
00:14:08.639 your and so once you've done that and
00:14:10.759 you you've had a bit of a play on with
00:14:12.360 it you've got familiar with it and
00:14:13.720 you're like okay I know how this works I
00:14:15.320 know that I know that Runway has this
00:14:16.839 feature that last going to go from image
00:14:18.199 to video okay great that's Now sort of
00:14:20.160 pined that and you're building your
00:14:21.279 knowledge Gap just by watching videos
00:14:23.399 and having a player up it's pretty cool
00:14:25.800 um and ultimately number four I would
00:14:28.720 make like a tools
00:14:32.800 DB where uh I'd like you to do this on
00:14:35.600 notion if you not hav't use notion
00:14:37.680 before n o t i o n notion and you can
00:14:42.320 create a bit of a tools dat database use
00:14:44.560 whatever you feel like really you could
00:14:45.880 use Google Docs or you could use Pages
00:14:47.880 or who use Pages word or or whatever
00:14:51.240 your favorite bloody document processing
00:14:53.360 thing is but some kind of database where
00:14:55.240 you've gone on these gages and then
00:14:56.759 you've got Runway Bam Bam Bam category
00:14:59.639 this this this best uses for this this
00:15:01.839 this features this this this and you
00:15:03.480 start to create your own internal
00:15:05.440 database of tools and I would highly
00:15:07.959 recommend you use some kind of like a a
00:15:09.560 database feature with a notion so you
00:15:11.480 can create your own columns and you can
00:15:13.000 add in you can do this in sheets as well
00:15:14.680 but notion is a lot easier for filtering
00:15:16.360 tier um and then you can set up filters
00:15:18.720 like okay this is a creative tool okay
00:15:20.720 this is uh could be useful for this
00:15:22.920 specific use case and you start to build
00:15:24.800 up this internal knowledge base or
00:15:26.959 database of the best tools and you've
00:15:29.199 rank them in in certain ways so that
00:15:31.160 when it comes to delivering that service
00:15:32.720 of this AI tools Consulting you can go
00:15:35.160 okay well we're looking for some
00:15:36.040 creative tools you're on a call with
00:15:37.639 them as I'm going to break down the
00:15:38.720 process in a second but you're on a call
00:15:39.959 with them and they say oh we've got a
00:15:42.040 we've got a team who does uh SEO writing
00:15:44.079 for us okay great well um you just go on
00:15:46.160 to your little thing not probably not on
00:15:47.480 the call but um uh afterwards or in the
00:15:50.319 in the report making P which I'll touch
00:15:51.759 on in a second and you can quickly pull
00:15:54.040 these up and you've got all this context
00:15:55.440 on it you can read through it you go oh
00:15:56.839 okay I remember that tool now great
00:15:58.560 great great okay now I can put that into
00:16:00.199 the recommendations so supp so that's
00:16:02.519 the process to start and by this point
00:16:04.639 if you've got a tools DB filled out with
00:16:06.519 50 tools and you've done a write up on
00:16:08.639 each of them and you've had to play
00:16:10.000 around with them as well you've got a
00:16:11.639 significant way down that so most of the
00:16:14.480 business are here you're now definitely
00:16:16.360 moving over this way and you start to
00:16:18.920 know what these tools are good for and
00:16:21.000 again you haven't had to go and build
00:16:22.480 all the stuff yourself you're purely
00:16:23.800 just recommending thing at the at this
00:16:25.759 time so to break break down what this
00:16:28.440 would actually look look like in in
00:16:29.880 reality I'm probably going to run a
00:16:31.639 whiteb space here but um the way you
00:16:35.480 pitch this is that you have some kind of
00:16:37.000 three-step process or something so say
00:16:38.839 it's a free and I'll get into how you
00:16:41.480 Market it in a second but free um AI
00:16:47.800 tools I'd probably play around with the
00:16:50.040 naming a bit more um to make it sound a
00:16:51.680 bit more sexy um but I'm sure you can
00:16:54.000 figure that out with the help of pla
00:16:55.440 which TBT but in principle you say one
00:16:58.920 we hop on a BRI
00:17:02.920 consult where you ask them a whole bunch
00:17:04.880 of questions and you learn about the
00:17:06.679 business in the different departments
00:17:07.799 and you sort of nudge it all down you
00:17:09.359 say okay great well after this call just
00:17:11.480 to make it extra easy for you I know
00:17:14.039 this is how I would have approached it
00:17:15.439 when how I did approach it when I first
00:17:16.880 did by Consulting calls is don't try to
00:17:19.039 put yourself on under the pump to
00:17:20.880 deliver on that call you want not if you
00:17:22.799 just starting out you're not good enough
00:17:24.079 you don't know enough and you can't be
00:17:25.679 expected to know enough to just be able
00:17:26.959 to be shooting off tools like
00:17:29.480 like immediately knowing what they
00:17:31.039 should fit into within the different
00:17:32.200 business departments maybe if you've
00:17:33.799 done enough here you could do confident
00:17:35.240 to but just to get started for most of
00:17:37.440 you I would say do the free console and
00:17:40.400 then say Okay step two of our process is
00:17:43.000 we'll um
00:17:45.080 match plus find
00:17:47.760 more so you can say we've got this this
00:17:50.160 internal database that we use that's got
00:17:51.760 all the best tools um and we match them
00:17:53.679 up uh internally but we'll also go out
00:17:56.240 and do a a further Deep dive for your
00:17:58.880 your business and for your industry
00:18:00.360 specifically so this way you can handle
00:18:01.720 a lot of different Industries and you
00:18:03.400 might be able to come up with some some
00:18:04.679 really cool ones that are specific to
00:18:05.960 that industry that you find um and here
00:18:08.440 you can use things like um there's an AI
00:18:11.200 for
00:18:13.600 that
00:18:16.520 or or you got uh Future
00:18:21.080 tools so there's these there's an AI for
00:18:23.720 that as a website where you can kind of
00:18:25.120 just search up if there's an AI tool for
00:18:27.760 the thing you need Future tools also is
00:18:29.919 a similar I'll put both those links down
00:18:31.919 below if you want to check those out but
00:18:34.080 this is step step two where you're
00:18:35.919 matching them with your internal ones
00:18:37.760 and also finding more and then step
00:18:40.960 three is a
00:18:46.000 report as a report so you write up a
00:18:48.480 report for them you can use like some
00:18:50.320 kind of Cana template or you could just
00:18:52.400 use a nice NAD and a bit of branding on
00:18:55.360 your uh Google Docs or you could just
00:18:57.440 just do it blank document me initially
00:18:59.840 just to keep things simple don't let
00:19:01.120 that stuff hold you back from just doing
00:19:02.640 it um and you write up a report for them
00:19:05.600 and you hop on another call or you just
00:19:07.240 send that to them directly I probably
00:19:08.400 hop on another call to get to sort of
00:19:10.159 run through that process and give give
00:19:11.720 them the idea and walk them through how
00:19:13.000 you want to do it get a bit of feedback
00:19:14.760 because all this is going to be helping
00:19:17.039 you to move further down this and just a
00:19:19.640 key P from getting to this point of
00:19:21.520 implementing is getting comfortable on
00:19:23.440 those sales calls and being like knowing
00:19:25.600 how to deal with people and you start to
00:19:27.240 realize oh there's all these different
00:19:28.880 characters I can meet and I know kind of
00:19:30.960 know how to handle that one that kind of
00:19:32.880 person now and it's just building up
00:19:34.880 those entrepreneurial and business
00:19:36.000 skills slowly but surely and this this
00:19:38.960 way you get two ches the free consult
00:19:41.559 and then you break down the report for
00:19:42.799 them now I know what you're asking Liam
00:19:46.240 how do I get clients and how do I make
00:19:48.000 money from us okay well first things
00:19:50.760 first is that what you get started money
00:19:53.440 is not really I know it might be like oh
00:19:55.159 I need I need to pay my bills and stuff
00:19:56.640 but you should not be starting one of
00:19:58.360 these business business is if you're in
00:19:59.799 a position where you are like okay I
00:20:02.039 need to I need to pay my bills next week
00:20:03.640 with this that is it's not going to work
00:20:05.960 maybe one in a 100 someone will just
00:20:07.880 finesse and like hustle their way to
00:20:09.440 make your money but for the most part
00:20:11.799 you are going to need to give this a
00:20:13.400 significant amount of time to get up and
00:20:15.080 running and that means taking on free
00:20:17.799 clients and building up your skills
00:20:19.240 slowly but surely and your
00:20:21.120 confidence you might be doing these
00:20:22.799 freak consults for for one or two months
00:20:25.240 even if you depending on the volume of
00:20:27.039 them you do until you really really good
00:20:29.120 at it and people are are really happy
00:20:31.000 with this the end result so this is
00:20:32.600 really the key key thing are they happy
00:20:34.760 afterwards so getting feedback on that
00:20:36.880 call or even getting feedback after by
00:20:38.720 email is essential checking in with them
00:20:41.039 maybe a week or two after they've
00:20:42.640 implemented them or probably a week or
00:20:44.320 two is about a good good amount of time
00:20:46.159 and if they're not saying wow yeah this
00:20:47.400 this has really been massively helpful
00:20:48.720 then you need to work work more on this
00:20:50.840 um in your matching process but going
00:20:52.960 back to getting clients to make money as
00:20:55.320 I said first off making money is not the
00:20:57.240 should not be the goal initially if you
00:20:59.240 want to really get to the end and you're
00:21:00.720 making a lot of money you need to take
00:21:02.559 that off your brain initially and just
00:21:04.280 work through the process slowly of
00:21:06.080 getting used talking on calls and and
00:21:07.799 building a knowledge Gap um and this is
00:21:09.720 really that the fly will for you to do
00:21:11.240 that but to give you the the longer term
00:21:15.240 uh strategy the process here is going to
00:21:17.880 be the
00:21:21.120 monetization is from eventually you can
00:21:24.720 use your affiliates
00:21:29.760 so you can get 20
00:21:32.000 15% of the monthly recurring that these
00:21:34.400 companies sign up to if these are decent
00:21:36.240 sized companies and they're going to be
00:21:37.720 high quality or or long-term users of
00:21:39.640 these apps then if you do enough of
00:21:41.159 these free audits you're going to build
00:21:42.360 up some passive income for yourself
00:21:44.039 where you might making a few hundred or
00:21:45.600 and eventually a few th000 per month
00:21:47.799 right so that's really determined by the
00:21:49.240 quality of the people that you're
00:21:50.679 putting through because if you're
00:21:51.720 getting some and also the quality of
00:21:53.679 your matching of the tools um and also
00:21:55.640 the affiliate commission that they pay
00:21:57.279 out but uh you'll see a lot of churn in
00:22:00.360 terms of okay I recommended that but
00:22:01.640 they never they used it for 2 months and
00:22:03.039 they fell off if you really find a good
00:22:04.880 tool for them then they will continue to
00:22:06.120 use that so that really comes down to
00:22:07.360 you but also making sure that the
00:22:08.600 business that you choose is uh with
00:22:10.880 someone who's going to be a long-term
00:22:12.039 user of it and not just kind of jump
00:22:13.320 around either they're too small to
00:22:14.760 really stick with it Etc but the second
00:22:17.760 way and there probably more of a longer
00:22:19.679 term one that you look to do is through
00:22:24.520 Partners so what you're doing here is
00:22:26.480 essentially taking people from being
00:22:27.919 unaware of or or not really implementing
00:22:29.960 AI into their business or being familiar
00:22:32.840 with it to the point where they're now
00:22:35.120 experimenting with it and they're like
00:22:36.400 oh well this is kind of cool I I they
00:22:38.000 start to see the value and it's like
00:22:40.080 when people first started putting
00:22:42.120 websites up and they started getting the
00:22:43.440 odd call from them it's like hey I just
00:22:44.880 found your website or they get an email
00:22:46.640 like hey I just found your website I was
00:22:48.480 wondering if you I could do this and
00:22:49.880 it's it's they start to see it okay like
00:22:52.480 now I get this now I get this web thing
00:22:54.200 and in this case I get this AI thing
00:22:56.080 like these really helpful tools for I
00:22:57.559 can search the whole web and Pon b or
00:22:59.640 write reports for us
00:23:02.240 um but the thing about that is that
00:23:04.400 you've just moved them down closer
00:23:06.720 towards the point where they're ready to
00:23:08.200 go to the implementation step they're
00:23:09.679 ready to maybe hop onto a a a more
00:23:11.880 expensive Consulting offer and an AI
00:23:14.240 audit with someone who can really do the
00:23:16.080 entire AI audit process and then stepp
00:23:18.279 them through to implementation so
00:23:19.640 Partners here at morning side we have
00:23:22.559 partners because we get so many leads
00:23:24.240 from this awesome Channel and and you

00:23:50.320 project if I'm honest um we have
00:23:52.360 Partners who we offer them to and if
00:23:53.960 they close that deal um we get anywhere
00:23:56.159 from 10 to 20% uh depending on the
00:23:58.039 partner um and the side with the deal so
00:23:59.960 you can do the same thing there are
00:24:02.120 people who are coming in and they do
00:24:03.640 have this side but they don't want to do
00:24:04.919 this side and you can find them either
00:24:06.520 in my free community or in paid
00:24:07.840 communities like my accelerator of

00:24:11.400 make this a sales pitch but if you're
00:24:12.919 looking to find high quality
00:24:14.039 implementation partners then you may
00:24:15.679 need to spend a bit of money to find get
00:24:17.600 in a group or get in an area or a place
00:24:19.600 online where you can find those deer
00:24:21.360 Partners or even look locally you can go
00:24:23.000 Google Maps and there might be some AI

00:25:11.960 from these unknown people who don't know
00:25:14.440 about your business at all or the offer

00:25:24.760 Audits and the best ways to get people
00:25:27.600 initially to get things off the ground
00:25:29.559 um there a few strategies firstly warm
00:25:35.000 Outreach Alexi has a great one on warm
00:25:37.880 Outreach which I'm not even going to try
00:25:39.120 to try to outdo um I'm going to put it
00:25:41.679 in the description below for you
00:25:43.279 basically you have a lot of people that
00:25:45.320 you have contact to either your older
00:25:46.640 email contacts your Facebook friends
00:25:48.080 your Instagram followers all the people
00:25:49.679 in your phone contacts and these are
00:25:51.279 people who either May themselves want
00:25:53.760 this kind of thing and say hey look I've
00:25:55.840 I've built this entire database of AI
00:25:57.559 tools I've spending a lot of time
00:25:59.159 working with them um and I'm doing this
00:26:00.799 thing right now I'm helping businesses
00:26:02.000 with free um to do a a 30 minute AI
00:26:05.159 tools audit um do you know anyone well
00:26:07.840 this is the patch and the warm Outreach
00:26:09.159 and this is what's going to be included
00:26:10.360 in that in that podcast from Alex Mo he
00:26:12.200 done part of his100 billion leads book
00:26:14.600 but it's the audio version again 100%
00:26:16.679 free um but that you can ask them if you
00:26:19.799 know anyone who'll be interested in this
00:26:22.640 kind of offer right and they either will
00:26:25.279 know people themselves or know people
00:26:27.120 that would be interested they say hey
00:26:28.919 yeah great I can put you in touch um or
00:26:31.320 they may be interested in it themselves
00:26:32.919 but by not asking them directly it's not
00:26:34.480 like hey man can you buy my Stu or like
00:26:36.960 can I do this week the fact that it's
00:26:39.159 free makes that actually a bit a bit a
00:26:41.320 little less bad like you probably could
00:26:42.760 just ask them directly and say hey like
00:26:45.600 you want me to do a free AI what for you
00:26:47.320 I know a whole bunch about these things
00:26:48.480 I just have a quick check over take 30
00:26:50.200 minutes um so that's one I'll leave a
00:26:52.480 link that down below um next TR would be
00:26:55.880 cold emo
00:26:59.679 this one takes a bit more to set up and
00:27:01.240 honestly wouldn't recommend it for
00:27:02.440 beginners but if you are familiar with
00:27:04.279 code email you could definitely blast
00:27:06.200 out this kind of offer once you test a
00:27:07.600 copy enough um to get them say hey like
00:27:09.880 yes sure I'd be interested um depending
00:27:12.039 on the targeting that you do of course
00:27:13.640 Cod whole different box of frogs um but
00:27:16.480 codium as one because you can reach out
00:27:17.840 to like hundreds of people a day with
00:27:19.399 the same offer start booking in calls
00:27:21.320 and moving them through their process
00:27:22.720 and then of course we have organic
00:27:26.399 content so you can try to on on LinkedIn
00:27:29.399 make social posts and stuff I would I'd
00:27:31.559 probably go the YouTube side personally
00:27:33.559 because then you can make videos like uh
00:27:36.000 best AI tools for for Builders or PL I
00:27:38.919 keep using Builders and Plum example I
00:27:40.880 think it's an interesting idea about AI
00:27:43.679 service providers for these industries
00:27:45.240 but making YouTube videos talking about
00:27:47.120 industry by industry the best tools um
00:27:49.240 you can even just use chat gbt or 01 or
00:27:52.159 whatever fancy model that you want to
00:27:53.480 use these days to help you think through
00:27:55.399 the problems that businesses would face
00:27:57.159 and then you with the without even
00:27:58.600 really knowing it sure you could jump on
00:27:59.840 Reddit you could jump on YouTube and do
00:28:01.159 a bit of market research about the
00:28:02.799 problems that a different Niche would
00:28:04.279 face and then you can match up with your
00:28:06.559 tools database you can go okay well this
00:28:08.519 tool this tool this tool this tool for
00:28:09.760 these different parts of the business
00:28:10.760 that I know they have issues with then
00:28:12.480 you can make a video six AI tools Reales
00:28:14.679 or Etc and you just kind of go through
00:28:16.240 the list and because those are tagged by
00:28:18.440 the niche that you put in the in the the
00:28:20.080 search ter or in the title when people
00:28:22.000 are search into AI stuff Realtors
00:28:23.799 there's a chance you're going to pop up
00:28:25.440 and then there's a chance that also book
00:28:26.840 in the free consult with you went in
00:28:28.559 that video you can say like literally
00:28:30.799 just before you get stuck into it or and
00:28:32.679 then probably towards the end as well do
00:28:34.279 two ctas in that so hey if you're
00:28:35.760 interested and a free AI tools consult
00:28:37.480 for your business head down below and
00:28:39.120 book and Accord me bam and once you've
00:28:41.640 got a good amount of uh traffic coming
00:28:44.159 from this you can actually turn this for
00:28:45.399 free and you can start charging um $100
00:28:48.760 for it you know my my Consulting calls
00:28:51.399 started off at I think 150 200 bucks
00:28:55.080 Jack that up to $300 cuz I getting so
00:28:57.000 many Jack it up to $500 cuz I was still
00:28:59.039 getting so many just like dozens and
00:29:01.080 dozens of calls um and I made $4,300
00:29:05.000 within my second or third month of doing
00:29:06.679 YouTube and and Consulting right and
00:29:09.080 then I put that up to $1,000 and people
00:29:10.799 still paying for that and I made
00:29:12.360 probably $15 $220,000 off $999 $997
00:29:17.000 calls um doing Consul so there D people
00:29:20.519 pay for it if you can get this up and
00:29:22.399 running that's how you get the money
00:29:23.880 coming but through warm Outreach I would
00:29:25.840 recommend that you do it for free um
00:29:28.200 build up until you're get in these
00:29:29.159 really happy customers and you know that
00:29:30.399 you're actually providing a good service
00:29:32.600 um so yeah there's also things like ads
00:29:34.919 but um for beginners I wouldn't
00:29:36.000 recommend you trying to own Facebook ads
00:29:37.799 to just try and get some uh get some
00:29:40.000 clients but I hope that makes sense
00:29:42.960 knowledge Gap you're starting way down
00:29:45.559 there this is your process to get some
00:29:47.480 kind of knowledge Gap and the way that
00:29:49.240 you monetize this knowledge Gap is to a
00:29:51.519 kind of offer like this where you were
00:29:53.679 just doing consultations to help them
00:29:55.440 match up the best AI tools you're
00:29:56.720 selling other people's products you're
00:29:58.320 getting compensated through Affiliates
00:29:59.880 and then through passing these people
00:30:01.080 off because you're doing the hard work
00:30:04.360 of maybe not a harder than actual
00:30:06.840 implementation but you're doing some
00:30:08.279 good work here where you're actually
00:30:09.720 you're moving them down from unaware or
00:30:12.480 unfamiliar with AI to being more
00:30:14.240 receptive to implementation so we're
00:30:16.399 found that if business owners don't
00:30:19.039 understand the tech and understand that
00:30:20.559 why it's good for their business and the
00:30:22.200 fact that this what we're going to be
00:30:23.679 building for you is actually really the
00:30:25.440 best play for you right now then there's
00:30:27.559 no that they get to implementation and
00:30:29.159 you can't sell them you can never sell
00:30:30.960 2030 $40,000 worth of AI uh for an AI
00:30:34.720 project if they don't first understand
00:30:36.880 all of the stuff so you're doing a key
00:30:38.279 part of the process and you can get
00:30:39.760 compensated by passing that off to
00:30:41.120 people once they're ready and of course
00:30:42.960 over time you will build up more skills
00:30:45.039 and you build up more experience you may
00:30:46.679 want to go into charging directly for
00:30:49.000 this once you've got a better lead
00:30:50.360 generation system you can start charging
00:30:52.039 for it maybe you put up a little
00:30:53.600 education product as a lead Mega to the
00:30:55.320 stabing stop running some traffic to the
00:30:57.480 you know there these different plays and
00:30:58.720 you try to move down and and expand your
00:31:00.559 offering so I started off I started off
00:31:03.080 on YouTube making YouTube videos talking
00:31:05.559 about the call AI builds also you can go
00:31:07.240 and look at it on my channel I was just
00:31:09.399 doing what was interesting to me and
00:31:10.799 building my knowledge Gap and putting up
00:31:13.559 coding tutorials and me building these
00:31:14.960 different things I loved it and and I
00:31:17.000 realized it there was a big market for
00:31:18.639 it as well um and that's how kind of got
00:31:20.880 my channel off the ground and built my
00:31:22.080 knowledge Gap and I started Consulting
00:31:23.799 so I was taking for educating on my
00:31:25.200 channel then I started doing consulting
00:31:27.039 like I said making lots of money off
00:31:28.480 Consulting within a few months of
00:31:29.760 starting my YouTube channel um and then
00:31:32.720 I started morning side AI my AI with a M
00:31:35.200 agency to do the implementation and
00:31:36.799 basically capture more of the value
00:31:38.760 that's possible within the AI space we
00:31:40.440 come come a long way from me and my
00:31:42.399 spare bedroom um and I'm extr proud of
00:31:45.600 what we've done and I can't wait to hear
00:31:47.080 about what all of you do and I know I
00:31:49.200 know I know it's so difficult to get off
00:31:50.840 the starting box when you feel like you
00:31:53.320 have absolutely no clue what to
00:31:55.399 do I I fully understand I was in your
00:31:57.360 position like six six years ago and I
00:31:59.840 was starting an online business I know
00:32:01.200 how that feels and I'm just really
00:32:02.279 trying I hope with this to give you that
00:32:04.919 little nudge and that that small wind
00:32:07.039 and the small steps that you need to
00:32:08.720 start putting a bit of momentum and
00:32:10.480 really building your entrepreneurial
00:32:11.799 skill set so that's all for this video
00:32:13.720 guys I will put those links down below
00:32:15.840 um but yeah if you want to see another
00:32:17.639 video here breaking down how you can use
00:32:20.639 organic content IO this recently um the
00:32:23.600 exact organic content funel that I've
00:32:25.120 used to ensure that my AI agency morning
00:32:28.279 s ey never runs out of leads I'll put
00:32:30.799 that up there so you can copy my exact
00:32:32.440 strategy but so that guys thank you so
00:32:34.039 much for watching and I will see you on
00:32:35.919 the next one
