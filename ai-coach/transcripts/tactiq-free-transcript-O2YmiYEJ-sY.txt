00:00:00.080 so over the Christmas and New Year break
00:00:01.520 I did a bunch of surveying in my school
00:00:02.960 community and elsewhere asking you all
00:00:04.759 what your biggest problems were in in
00:00:06.440 the current moment with your AI
00:00:07.680 automation agency and one of the biggest
00:00:09.800 problems that uh revealed itself is that
00:00:11.679 you guys are struggling with consistent
00:00:13.519 uh lead generation and you might have
00:00:14.920 just started the business and you've got
00:00:16.480 maybe your first client or two but you
00:00:18.080 don't have to take it to that next stage
00:00:19.760 of saying oh now I've got a consistent
00:00:21.760 stream of bookings coming in so you can
00:00:23.640 actually start to hire a team and and
00:00:25.240 have some kind of consistency so that
00:00:27.000 you know you can actually build this
00:00:28.519 business on a longer term basis then
00:00:30.119 than just like one client to the other
00:00:31.480 and always worrying about where the next
00:00:32.880 one's coming from so in this video I'm
00:00:34.920 going to be walking you through
00:00:36.280 basically the exact system that I've
00:00:37.440 used to generate thousands of leads for
00:00:39.440 my AI automation agency morning site Ai
00:00:41.840 and uh really just give you a bit of a
00:00:43.960 marketing Master Class if I do say so
00:00:45.719 myself um from my six years in in
00:00:47.879 digital marketing I've done everything
00:00:49.360 from like running paid ads to sell
00:00:51.120 physical products through like Shopify
00:00:52.520 Drop Shipping Etc um marketing agency um
00:00:55.960 sort of T way from May and more
00:00:58.559 importantly and more recently organic
00:01:00.760 content funnels and how to make content
00:01:03.359 like this and on other platforms and to
00:01:05.799 consistently this is infinitely if you
00:01:07.680 can't see it but to consistently convert
00:01:09.720 strangers into uh leads and then
00:01:12.640 ultimately to sales as well so I'm not
00:01:14.240 going to be touching on the sales
00:01:15.439 section in this video think that
00:01:16.960 deserved its whole own own own video
00:01:19.439 entirely but I'm going to focus on the
00:01:21.200 lead generation portion of breaking down
00:01:24.320 exactly how this works I think a lot of
00:01:25.720 you want to do this but you don't quite
00:01:27.920 understand don't quite understand how
00:01:29.680 this mechanism work so it's actually not
00:01:31.759 too complex and I'm going to break it
00:01:32.960 down for you um and at the end of the
00:01:34.320 video I'm going to be giving you a a
00:01:36.119 resource that you can take to put this
00:01:37.759 into plan so I know you guys might look
00:01:39.399 at what I do on YouTube now and think
00:01:40.799 that's that's sort of a bit more
00:01:42.040 advanced than I'm I'm able to do right
00:01:43.520 now but I'm going to boil this down to
00:01:45.360 if I was starting again um and I mean
00:01:47.680 I've generated like 10 10 million plus
00:01:50.600 views or something I got a lot of
00:01:51.799 subscribers next to my name so I know a
00:01:54.079 decent amount about this and uh I'm
00:01:57.640 going to give you what I would the exact
00:01:59.159 strategy and the sort of blueprint for
00:02:01.079 starting a organic content FAL like this
00:02:03.240 that I would do if I was getting started
00:02:04.600 again with my AI automation agency so to
00:02:07.240 get started this is going to be a bit of
00:02:08.720 a slow piece video by the way um this is
00:02:11.038 Sunday afternoon here uh and guys are
00:02:13.800 out there building this La so I this is
00:02:16.360 a good chance for me to give you guys a
00:02:17.519 breakdown of the marketing side of
00:02:18.959 things so it's not going to be super Tik
00:02:20.560 Tok brain optimized I'm sorry but I
00:02:22.879 promise you it's going to be some
00:02:24.519 extremely valuable information for you
00:02:26.120 if you are looking to scale your aration
00:02:28.319 agency in 2025 by generating consist of
00:02:31.040 leads so the whole process of lead
00:02:34.680 generation and I mean the the entire PL
00:02:36.640 acquisition part of the business is to
00:02:38.519 turn strangers into customers right so
00:02:41.519 that's like the whole thing stranger
00:02:43.519 never heard of you before to customer so
00:02:46.319 we can call these cold these people are
00:02:49.440 cold right you have different um
00:02:51.760 temperatures you have cold and then
00:02:53.640 people will call it
00:02:56.159 warm and then you can call it hot so
00:02:58.840 these are different audience
00:02:59.920 temperatures and this is pretty
00:03:02.680 fundamental marketing uh terminology
00:03:06.440 cold audiences never heard of you before
00:03:08.239 warm audiences people who have heard
00:03:10.360 from you before maybe they' referred to
00:03:11.799 you or they've engaged the content
00:03:13.200 before or they've given you the email
00:03:14.360 Etc they're warm they've taken some kind
00:03:16.239 of they're no longer strangers and hot
00:03:18.519 are people who are showing extreme like
00:03:20.640 serious buying intent and they are
00:03:23.040 likely closable if you make the right
00:03:24.959 offer or get in front of them in the
00:03:26.560 right way so that's first things first
00:03:28.799 so up here is all the strangers and so
00:03:31.720 when you are trying to Market your your
00:03:33.680 business or regardless of if it's AI
00:03:35.360 automation agency or other you have
00:03:37.080 these strangers and what content allows
00:03:38.959 you to do and this is being an organic
00:03:40.959 content funnel I think that that term
00:03:43.360 was calling by Matt Gray um and he's
00:03:45.200 done a lot of lot of stuff and sort of
00:03:46.879 explaining how this organic content
00:03:48.760 final works and it's been very helpful
00:03:50.040 for me to understand what I've been
00:03:51.959 doing all along and and putting into a
00:03:53.599 bit more of a uh a framework like this
00:03:56.000 so shout out to M great for
00:03:57.920 that what we're trying to do is turn
00:03:59.840 strangers into into these are book
00:04:01.799 meetings let go these bookings on your
00:04:04.920 calendar and these are
00:04:08.439 closes the first thing you need to do
00:04:10.360 when it comes to content is to get
00:04:13.280 awareness right the first problem is
00:04:15.280 it's right this up here problem
00:04:21.519 one is awareness No One Ever Knows who
00:04:24.960 you
00:04:27.160 are and awareness step is taking these
00:04:29.960 Stranges and putting them into this
00:04:31.280 first one so we can say this is
00:04:35.440 going and converting them into this
00:04:37.520 middle one so the thing of content is
00:04:40.120 that certain platforms have
00:04:41.960 discoverability engines like say Here on
00:04:43.440 YouTube If you make content that is
00:04:46.080 talking about how uh Builders can use AI
00:04:49.000 or the best real estate AI
00:04:50.919 systems YouTube has an algorithm that
00:04:53.000 allows you to be discovered so it'll try
00:04:54.880 to find people or either through YouTube
00:04:57.320 search or uh just being recommended on
00:04:59.280 their on the brows that will try to
00:05:01.520 convert or at least show those videos to
00:05:03.919 these strangers and if you are appealing
00:05:06.680 to what those strangers are interested
00:05:07.960 them say these are these red dots might
00:05:09.880 be your Builders right and this is just
00:05:11.360 the millions of people on these
00:05:12.520 platforms there are red dots in that
00:05:15.000 audience you just need to be able to
00:05:16.720 attract them and convert that uh convert
00:05:19.600 them from strangers into people who are
00:05:21.680 aware of you so this is the awareness
00:05:24.080 problem and the way you do this is for
00:05:25.600 making content that is targeted to a
00:05:27.600 certain group of people so
00:05:29.960 top five AI automations for builders in
00:05:32.560 2025 simple like just more ideas like
00:05:35.680 that and this goes with the same thing
00:05:37.280 for if you're posting on LinkedIn or if
00:05:39.479 you're posting on X Etc but you need to
00:05:41.600 solve this first problem of awareness
00:05:43.120 and that's done through creating content
00:05:44.919 and posting on platforms that allow you
00:05:46.360 to be discovered so and Tik Tok is a
00:05:48.600 great example of this because they were
00:05:49.840 the first ones if you go back a few
00:05:52.080 years before we had reals on Instagram
00:05:54.199 if you made a new Instagram account and
00:05:56.120 you started posting the most amazing
00:05:57.400 content ever but you had no followers
00:05:59.199 you won't going to get any any
00:06:00.680 engagement because there's no
00:06:01.919 discoverability you're not getting
00:06:03.800 yourself in front of anyone new so this
00:06:05.840 is when for you pages and stuff like
00:06:07.599 that will popularize through popularized
00:06:09.759 through Tik Tok and uh Instagram of
00:06:12.039 course A B with that and YouTube's
00:06:13.479 always been kind of a discoverability
00:06:15.280 engine like that so if you want to solve
00:06:17.639 this first problem of turning strangers
00:06:19.639 into into paying customers you need to
00:06:21.560 think about how you solve this awareness
00:06:22.960 thing that's going to be done through
00:06:24.520 using a platform like YouTube or through
00:06:26.720 Instagram reals or whatever where they
00:06:29.680 an engine that can allow you to be shown
00:06:31.080 to people who are not your followers
00:06:32.520 otherwise you're going to have a much
00:06:33.479 harder time say if you started a Twitter
00:06:35.440 account and you got zero followers I
00:06:37.080 believe they may be incorporating more
00:06:38.960 of a a discoverability engine into
00:06:41.039 Twitter um yeah I think there's people
00:06:43.479 you follow and then like General post as
00:06:45.479 well so seeme that they have integrated
00:06:47.639 that as well but that's the first
00:06:49.280 problem is getting them across here and
00:06:51.240 these guys to see your content and
00:06:54.280 ideally follow you so I'm going to say
00:06:55.800 this first step from completely cold
00:06:57.720 into this sort of warm area these are
00:06:59.879 people who have um
00:07:03.960 seen your
00:07:08.160 content um followed
00:07:11.479 you followed SL
00:07:14.639 subscribed and this is basically Victory
00:07:16.680 number one for you have you made
00:07:17.919 something that is appealing to the
00:07:21.120 people that you're trying to find and
00:07:22.800 it's converted them from a stranger it's
00:07:24.360 going on to clip or to stock scrolling
00:07:26.759 and they've watched your content and IDE
00:07:28.319 they've followed you subscribed to this
00:07:29.520 this puts them in kind of the holding
00:07:31.280 day of okay now I get a chance to keep
00:07:33.479 sending more sending more uh value and
00:07:36.360 and passing more value that way through
00:07:37.599 my posts right so um you can be found on
00:07:40.520 on YouTube and they subscribe to you and
00:07:42.160 the way YouTube works is that it's going
00:07:43.360 to provide it's going to push those
00:07:44.879 videos onto the uh the Brows page and
00:07:47.840 also in the subscription tab but the
00:07:49.479 main thing is that if you're subscribed
00:07:50.680 to some like me if you're subscribed to
00:07:52.120 me my videos are going to pop up in your
00:07:54.319 home feed a lot more because you

00:07:59.240 get value out of it because I I really
00:08:00.879 try to pack as much and and thank you
00:08:02.240 for all the nice comments on some of the
00:08:03.440 recent videos like I really do
00:08:05.479 appreciate it um and I hope you guys
00:08:08.120 know that I'm I'm really trying to put
00:08:10.520 you guys on here and
00:08:12.479 uh yeah I really trying and um I I know
00:08:17.319 a lot of you see that and appreciate
00:08:19.639 that I'm I'm trying to be straight up
00:08:20.919 with you all about things um yeah I just
00:08:24.280 appreciate you all for for everything
00:08:26.000 you've done for me and my team and stuff
00:08:27.840 like that but I don't want to get a
00:08:28.800 mushy on you but
00:08:30.319 um allow me to do this stuff and this is
00:08:32.599 what I love so so see content and you've
00:08:36.279 solved that problem problem number one
00:08:38.080 awareness is solved and that is they've
00:08:40.599 got you've got them on some kind of
00:08:41.599 holding platform now the important thing
00:08:43.200 to understand here is that this these
00:08:44.680 are called rented audiences right these
00:08:46.959 are bad well they they're better than
00:08:49.200 cold it's obviously better than no one
00:08:50.959 knowing you exist but these are
00:08:57.200 rented these oriented audiences rented
00:09:00.200 meaning you are a guest on the YouTube
00:09:02.959 platform or you are a guest on the
00:09:05.079 xplatform or whichever one you're of
00:09:07.519 basically at any point they could turn
00:09:09.200 the lights off of your account all of
00:09:11.000 your access to them is determined by the
00:09:12.760 algorithm and by uh staying within the
00:09:15.600 bounds of of what's allowed on that
00:09:16.800 platform so it's rent bothers is good
00:09:18.839 you can have like oh I'm just going to
00:09:20.959 ditch these down here by the way you
00:09:23.079 could have 10,000
00:09:25.440 followers or you make content that
00:09:27.360 allows you over the course of a few
00:09:28.800 months you're eventually gather 10,000
00:09:31.279 followers 10,000 people who want to be
00:09:33.160 basically subscribed to see more content
00:09:34.880 like that um and this can also be done
00:09:37.880 through what's called a CTA so this is a
00:09:39.920 bit more marketing CTO call to action
00:09:42.839 say in this video I could say if you
00:09:45.360 enjoy this kind of content and you want
00:09:46.959 to learn how to build AI businesses and
00:09:49.120 and make an impact on the world and uh
00:09:51.880 see the the best version of yourself
00:09:53.640 through this awesome vehicle then
00:09:54.839 subscribe to the channel see I just did
00:09:56.160 it that's that's called a CTA so I just
00:09:58.160 did a call to action to get you to
00:09:59.480 subscribe to the the channel so that you
00:10:01.000 see more content like this pretty basic
00:10:02.760 stuff I know um but you can do this in
00:10:04.519 written content as well so the CTA here
00:10:06.640 would be hey subscribe to me for more
00:10:08.600 content like this which is what I just
00:10:10.000 said to you and hopefully some of you
00:10:11.360 have subscribed if you haven't already
00:10:13.839 and this is how you get your your
00:10:15.079 follows or whatever the the platform
00:10:17.600 specific one is and
00:10:19.399 then we need to convert these rented
00:10:21.760 audiences which is good to have but
00:10:23.920 still not uh not what you really want um
00:10:26.839 and can be taken away at any point as we
00:10:28.399 saw through I know that the whole Co
00:10:30.360 thing certain people getting completely
00:10:31.560 taken off and in various different
00:10:33.240 platforms if you say the wrong thing
00:10:34.360 you're gone so if you're running a
00:10:35.959 business you want to have Diversified or
00:10:38.880 definitely factored in that risk that
00:10:40.920 you could get nuked at any point and so
00:10:42.920 this is when we get into what's called
00:10:45.399 um this blue one doesn't work that well
00:10:47.560 oh
00:10:48.600 sorry a red a red Tech uh of owned
00:10:56.200 audiences now this is the really really
00:10:58.560 really important so say we're doing the
00:11:00.320 building example and we've gone and
00:11:01.920 we've got we've managed to pull a bunch
00:11:03.360 of Builders out we've made some really
00:11:04.920 good stuff that appeals to builders on
00:11:06.440 YouTube or maybe you've got on Instagram
00:11:08.079 because you realize that Instagram is a
00:11:09.240 better platform for finding Builders um
00:11:11.560 that is something you need to factor in
00:11:12.760 if you're othering a Content system like
00:11:14.320 this um if you're trying to find a
00:11:17.160 certain type of person it's like
00:11:19.440 would SE level exacts be watching
00:11:22.360 YouTube and picking around I'm sure
00:11:23.800 there's some but you need to make sure
00:11:25.399 you're using the right platform to find
00:11:26.639 the right people so that's uh that's l
00:11:29.560 there but the owned audiences we've got
00:11:31.360 we Sol a problem L of getting awareness
00:11:32.839 with my content that YouTube has served
00:11:34.560 to these Builders or they found it
00:11:35.959 through the search engine like top
00:11:38.800 automations for Builders all five things
00:11:41.240 every Builder should know about AI
00:11:43.240 moving you get and so we've got them in
00:11:46.240 this rented audience now we need to try
00:11:47.880 and move um so let's say this is all
00:11:50.040 full of
00:11:51.839 them we now need to try to move some of
00:11:54.160 them across
00:11:55.519 this and into our rented audience now
00:11:58.200 what is a rented audience
00:12:00.200 typically um General marketing is just
00:12:03.160 the email can you get your email so this
00:12:05.600 is there's
00:12:08.639 email and then there's
00:12:11.480 SMS and then obviously there's like
00:12:13.320 WhatsApp and any other things so
00:12:14.600 basically you can I mean WhatsApp also
00:12:18.120 could WhatsApp you're still technically
00:12:19.360 using their platform then you could be
00:12:20.480 banned so email and SMS are kind of
00:12:22.720 commiss L um you do need to obviously
00:12:24.639 stick within the the realm of uh good
00:12:27.199 email practices to not get banned and
00:12:28.760 also uh SMS to your list should be fine
00:12:31.720 yeah there's basically nothing Le just
00:12:33.199 spamming them but basically you have the
00:12:35.160 number you have their email and you can
00:12:36.839 communicate with them whenever you want
00:12:38.800 and however you want until unless you
00:12:41.000 make them unsubscribe um but that the
00:12:43.160 point is that you have control over
00:12:45.320 they've opted and they've given you
00:12:46.720 their their their details so they have
00:12:48.680 permission to contact them and the most
00:12:50.000 important thing about business um maybe
00:12:53.839 uh definitely one of the most important
00:12:55.079 things is being able to communicate
00:12:56.600 directly to your customer base and if
00:12:58.720 you think about
00:12:59.720 if you send an email out to a 10,000
00:13:02.720 person email list you might get 30 to
00:13:04.800 40% of those opening so even then when
00:13:07.079 you've got their email only you and then
00:13:08.880 how many of them actually read the whole
00:13:10.040 thing so then that's when you realize
00:13:11.800 how difficult it truly is to to like get
00:13:15.800 a little bit of the brain space of all
00:13:17.560 the people you're trying to work with so
00:13:18.959 whether that's you're hitting them with
00:13:20.120 with lots of content all over the place
00:13:21.600 you're hitting them with emails even
00:13:23.000 with all of that noise and all of that
00:13:24.399 value you're throwing at them it's still
00:13:26.120 quite hard to get through to them that's
00:13:27.880 why having a direct L to them is such a
00:13:30.240 valuable thing and that's why it's
00:13:31.279 important to try to get an owned
00:13:32.760 audience so the way you do this um and
00:13:35.160 I'm even going to show you how to do it
00:13:36.519 with this video because I'm I'm going to
00:13:37.680 attach the the free resource with this
00:13:39.160 for you guys to to build out your own uh
00:13:41.360 your own organic content funnel like
00:13:42.839 this but you need some kind of value or
00:13:45.880 CTA or something and a lot of people in
00:13:47.880 my accelerator to do this um are doing
00:13:50.560 very very well at length it I try to um
00:13:53.079 put a couple of the LinkedIn profiles of
00:13:55.399 them down there if I can I can find some
00:13:57.320 Goods um but basically they're doing
00:14:00.680 content that is getting people to engage
00:14:03.320 with it's like hey these these 20 make
00:14:05.199 automations to automate your business in
00:14:08.320 2025 kind of broad things and you have
00:14:10.639 like a a loom video showing those make
00:14:12.720 Automation and fairly fairly standard I
00:14:15.320 feel like I feel like we've made it
00:14:16.600 standard on on link because of how much
00:14:18.320 we're pushing it in the accelerator but
00:14:20.120 you guys probably see it all the time if
00:14:22.360 you don't then hop on link and and
00:14:23.920 follow a couple a automation agency
00:14:25.880 owners and you definitely see a lot of
00:14:27.040 it but something that you make some
00:14:29.560 content on here uh on say LinkedIn or
00:14:31.839 YouTube or whatever and then you attach
00:14:33.639 to it some kind of offer so another
00:14:36.880 CTA saying hey if you enjoyed this I've
00:14:39.360 actually got even more value or even
00:14:40.920 more stuff to give you and I'm going to
00:14:42.839 put it um just behind this thing where
00:14:44.720 you have to give me an email and so that
00:14:46.680 step is getting them into say uh email
00:14:52.880 list and so of course you can just say
00:14:54.880 sign up to my newsletter but there's not
00:14:56.320 much value behind that so I mean use an
00:14:58.440 example of of what I've literally given
00:14:59.920 to you guys in this video um it's a
00:15:03.320 free
00:15:05.480 resource at what's called a lead
00:15:10.480 magnet um and that CTA is going to
00:15:14.120 takeen from this audience here the
00:15:15.920 rental audience into your owned audience
00:15:17.680 where you have the email or SMS and now
00:15:19.639 in here is an important mechanism um
00:15:23.480 that is is probably one of the Lesser
00:15:25.759 understood ones in in the entire sort of
00:15:28.079 marketing space and this is something
00:15:29.600 that took me quite a while to to realize
00:15:31.279 as well so there's another very very
00:15:33.240 important stage and it's
00:15:35.959 called
00:15:42.240 nurturing and this is what happens in
00:15:45.399 this section here mean it's technically
00:15:47.639 happening here but nurturing is
00:15:49.240 basically just building up sort of
00:15:51.920 trust um I respect all those lovey doy
00:15:56.800 words um
00:15:59.360 Authority and just like this we do it at
00:16:01.440 morning side AI with our uh with our
00:16:03.360 customer list and they like the people
00:16:04.880 that would be on Sal SCS that we would
00:16:06.079 like to close at a later dat um the
00:16:08.759 exact same process works for uh say
00:16:11.199 education businesses like like the the
00:16:12.920 Tria accelerator ir and more so for you
00:16:15.319 guys it's doing the exact same thing for
00:16:16.720 nurturing your AI automation agency
00:16:18.560 leads um so nurturing is is a key step
00:16:22.399 and it can be done through content with
00:16:24.560 like you guys watch my Channel right now
00:16:25.759 if you guys had a YouTube channel you
00:16:27.720 technically nurture them but what you
00:16:28.959 you can do is you can run emails to push
00:16:31.199 them out of your list to watch the video
00:16:33.639 and that continues to prove your
00:16:35.440 expertise build a relationship with them
00:16:37.639 they say you need like seven touch
00:16:38.959 points on average these days in order to
00:16:40.920 sell something and so if you guys are
00:16:42.639 trying
00:16:43.440 to convert these Builders again when
00:16:46.759 using the builders I these Builders into
00:16:48.680 people who are uh booked onto your
00:16:51.000 calendar so this is this book these
00:16:52.959 bookings they come out the second stage
00:16:55.480 um then
00:17:00.279 then you need to have some way to prove
00:17:01.680 that you know what you're talking about
00:17:02.800 that you're someone that they can
00:17:04.480 help then then you need to prove that
00:17:07.400 you are someone that can actually help
00:17:08.559 them to achieve what they want to
00:17:09.799 achieve and that's in this case of being
00:17:12.400 their guide to better understand Ai and
00:17:14.880 to use it to improve your business so
00:17:17.079 this nurture step is is so critical and
00:17:18.959 that's why it's really important to get
00:17:20.559 them into that that own audience because
00:17:22.359 you get a chance to consistently nurture
00:17:23.880 them say the the way you put this into
00:17:26.079 your strategy for the builders is once a
00:17:29.120 week or twice a week you'll talk about
00:17:31.320 one handy or maybe like an interview
00:17:33.280 that you did with a client or a
00:17:34.559 breakdown of a case study that you did
00:17:36.440 or a a list of Handy tools or things
00:17:38.360 that they should look into or a you know
00:17:40.679 there's so many different ways that you
00:17:42.240 can prove that you know what you're
00:17:43.320 talking about or or that you like an
00:17:45.120 interesting story that that you had when
00:17:46.919 you're working with a client recently
00:17:48.640 this kind of stuff and providing for you
00:17:49.919 value and and really writing a story of
00:17:51.679 how you want them to perceive you was
00:17:53.480 critical maybe you did a did a podcast
00:17:55.559 or an interview with someone and you
00:17:56.720 just shoot that out to email us hey guys
00:17:58.480 just had a chat with one of the biggest
00:18:00.720 uh
00:18:01.600 building building Contracting firms in
00:18:04.280 my my city and with the CEO and we walk
00:18:07.480 through this this this this this then
00:18:08.559 you shoot it out to email list basically
00:18:10.520 at some point they will be like wow this
00:18:12.760 guy is the person that I need to to work
00:18:15.000 with to get what I want to get done and
00:18:17.159 that's when you make the final
00:18:22.280 CTA and this is going to be to um your
00:18:26.520 calendar
00:18:29.720 and so at the end of all of these these
00:18:31.200 nurture steps when you're shooting out
00:18:32.320 email shooting out emails you include at
00:18:34.360 the end of that email or the SMS or yeah
00:18:37.039 teally they're just going to be the
00:18:38.000 email most most time it's going to be
00:18:39.360 your email and use at it um and there's
00:18:41.280 going to be CT like hey by the way I've
00:18:43.120 actually just opened up a few more spots
00:18:44.559 we've just got this great result for XYZ
00:18:46.520 that's what was in the email a breakdown
00:18:48.360 of a client case study or something
00:18:49.480 you've been working on recently or or a
00:18:51.320 learning that you had and said by the
00:18:53.039 way I've also got a a few spaces opened
00:18:55.120 up on my calendar um we're taking on a
00:18:56.799 few more clients for next month put a
00:18:58.200 bit of mergency and scarcity in there we
00:18:59.919 find out that morning so that's always
00:19:01.520 always great um I mean you can fabricate
00:19:04.559 it but I mean it's we we don't need to
00:19:06.919 fabricate it because because we actually
00:19:08.320 have it but it went before we needed
00:19:10.280 before we were at the stage rack um we
00:19:12.360 did need to fabricate it so if you need
00:19:13.679 to fabricate SC scarcity and urgency but
00:19:16.200 you guys just being absolutely packed
00:19:17.760 out I mean we had to do it when we first
00:19:19.520 got started I don't think it's it's
00:19:21.360 legal by any means um but a bit of Edy
00:19:24.640 is great to get them to make their junk
00:19:25.840 and book a call and so here is when we
00:19:28.480 start getting those infinite leads and
00:19:30.240 booking flowing out and now this is
00:19:32.400 going to be far better compared to say a
00:19:35.000 direct response marketing method like C
00:19:36.720 emo where you're taking them from here
00:19:38.600 to here and you're trying to do it in
00:19:41.919 like a day or like maybe a few days if
00:19:45.080 you got if you've got the full sequence
00:19:46.480 going but you see this is a lot slower
00:19:48.919 so theid direct response direct response
00:19:51.320 marketing is um a a style of marketing
00:19:54.240 we very much focus on Fast Roi missable
00:19:56.480 results um and always making very strong
00:19:58.720 clear offers with urgency and security
00:20:00.400 Etc um this is a bit of a combination
00:20:04.280 cuz we've got these these direct
00:20:05.520 response styled things we we're trying
00:20:07.400 to push and measure this conversion okay
00:20:09.760 how many people are watching my content
00:20:11.039 and how many people are subscribing to
00:20:12.360 my email list okay that's a you're
00:20:14.039 getting a a direct response from that
00:20:15.640 content but more broadly this nurturing
00:20:17.919 step becomes a longer a longer time
00:20:21.720 Horizon where it's not so much direct
00:20:23.200 response and it's more so okay how can I
00:20:26.159 uh get as many people in here and just
00:20:28.720 over time just peer W and some people
00:20:30.480 are going to take lower than numbers uh
00:20:32.120 some people are going to convert very
00:20:33.200 quickly but if you get a good mix of
00:20:34.919 value that you give there and then also
00:20:36.360 offers like you could put in once a
00:20:38.080 month at the end of the month at the
00:20:39.640 start of the month a direct offer to
00:20:41.400 your email list saying hey guys we have
00:20:43.640 uh uh just wrapped up three more
00:20:45.360 projects and uh we're actually taking on
00:20:47.120 two more so um I'd love to work with
00:20:49.200 another another building company locally
00:20:51.720 um you can book and a call directly with
00:20:53.240 me here and we can have a chat about how
00:20:54.919 we can help your
00:20:56.919 business so that will Mak
00:20:59.240 sense I know might seem like a lot of
00:21:01.440 work but the biggest thing that you guys
00:21:04.559 were asking me about and the forms I put
00:21:06.799 out is this consistently lead generation
00:21:09.240 question and yes this seems like a lot
00:21:12.640 but consistently acquiring leads does
00:21:15.200 take a lot of effort it's it's one like
00:21:17.360 80% of your job as the founder in the
00:21:19.960 early stag of the business should be
00:21:21.120 focused on it's just this this this like
00:21:23.400 how can I make myself more know how can
00:21:25.559 I take strangers and make some kind of
00:21:28.080 touch point with with them and then give
00:21:29.679 them some free value and get them on my
00:21:31.039 email list so to bring this kind of down
00:21:34.039 to earth for you all and like I said
00:21:35.960 this sales portion after on your
00:21:37.480 calendar is a is a whole other story
00:21:39.320 that I can probably do in another video
00:21:40.520 for We but you guys really need to get
00:21:43.559 serious about setting up something like
00:21:44.840 this because the time involvement
00:21:48.640 content creation if you get it by them
00:21:51.200 you can be
00:21:52.120 doing 10 hours a week of of content
00:21:55.200 creation and when you focus on you sit
00:21:56.840 down or two mornings a week and you just
00:21:59.320 bang out some really valuable stuff you
00:22:00.679 look back over your calendar there's all
00:22:02.039 sorts of ideation strategies um that's I
00:22:04.080 can make a whole other video on that the
00:22:05.400 exact ideation strategies I used to come
00:22:07.120 up with like 200 ideas for content in uh
00:22:10.679 in a few hours but then you can schedule
00:22:12.440 it up you can say okay I'm going to get
00:22:13.919 a content manager in or I'm just going
00:22:15.159 to schedule it out myself initially and
00:22:17.760 be consistently posting across just one
00:22:19.720 platform to start that's what i'
00:22:20.880 recommend and moving people through
00:22:22.840 these you may not get them immediately
00:22:24.559 jumping over but I see so many of you
00:22:26.360 doing like the real really the main
00:22:27.919 thing that I want to talk talk on this
00:22:28.919 video is
00:22:29.840 that so many of you are doing good stuff
00:22:32.240 on the content side and you're
00:22:34.559 getting you're getting engagement I see
00:22:36.880 a lot of people accelerator in the free
00:22:38.320 school Community um getting engagement
00:22:40.760 on the social post and lot of people
00:22:42.520 like yeah send me this send me that send
00:22:43.799 me that but I don't hear as much about
00:22:45.840 it like hey yeah I'm just consistently
00:22:47.360 closing his deals it's like I got a lot
00:22:48.640 of interest but I haven't seen to to
00:22:50.559 convert that into into as many clients
00:22:53.200 as I thought I would and the people who
00:22:55.320 have figured it out and the ones who are
00:22:56.720 really scaling their agencies right now
00:22:58.200 have realize that there's a step where
00:23:00.320 yes you provided value with your content
00:23:02.400 now you need to capture that and you
00:23:04.279 need to also schedule time each week to
00:23:07.320 manage this owned this owned audience so
00:23:09.880 that you've WR your list and you are
00:23:11.240 consistently piering them with value
00:23:13.000 even if it's just 100 people or 200
00:23:14.760 people initially just start shipping
00:23:16.480 away and building that up because soon
00:23:17.799 enough you will have again if you just
00:23:19.880 stick to this for 6 12 months if you
00:23:22.279 want to do building as a niche way again
00:23:24.320 any if you haven't watched my niching
00:23:25.840 video I just thought it it really breaks
00:23:27.720 down the best way to your your perfect
00:23:29.200 nich 2025 and Beyond this process is
00:23:32.400 going to allow you to consistently pull
00:23:34.559 people from the unaware and have no clue
00:23:37.000 the cold audience who doesn't know who
00:23:38.240 you are down through these with
00:23:40.840 consistent content output and then
00:23:42.799 inconsistent news vors as well and so
00:23:45.279 this is exactly what I've done to
00:23:46.679 generate uh 2,000 or more leads from
00:23:50.919 through my YouTube channel it's probably
00:23:52.000 more 3,000 out um and then also we've
00:23:55.159 got the all of the people who book in a
00:23:56.480 call us we have the email and we do
00:23:58.720 gratic emails to keep n basically
00:24:00.480 whenever we need more clients the reason
00:24:01.760 we've always been bed out is because
00:24:03.880 we'll either go back to the people who
00:24:05.200 are on the waiting list or we'll shoot
00:24:06.880 out an email to our the people who we
00:24:09.480 turned away cuz we're too busy and shoot
