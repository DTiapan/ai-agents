# https://www.youtube.com/watch/QODGOoFPkhs

00:00:00.080 hey everyone Liam hotley here and today
00:00:02.440 just wanted to make a quick video Even
00:00:04.040 though this is the holiday season and I
00:00:05.480 hope you're all having a great time with
00:00:07.160 your family and friends that's what you
00:00:08.400 celebrate but I wanted to make a uh sort
00:00:11.559 of looking forward video into 2025 for
00:00:13.719 those of you with an AI automation
00:00:15.839 agency who want to really be on the
00:00:17.760 front foot and I'm going to be sharing
00:00:19.600 what I have seen significant shifts in
00:00:21.519 the market on my end um at Morningside
00:00:23.680 Ai and what I suspect to be one of the
00:00:25.720 driving forces of change and uh really
00:00:28.720 where everything is going with this
00:00:30.039 space um within 2025 and Beyond and so I
00:00:32.840 wanted to make this quick BD just
00:00:34.200 breaking down what we're seeing on our
00:00:35.640 end and how you guys can start to
00:00:37.280 position your agencies to benefit from
00:00:39.399 what I think is going to be the big
00:00:40.440 shift in the market in 2025 so um this
00:00:43.480 goes right back to what I've talked
00:00:45.719 about a lot on this channel um earlier
00:00:48.120 earlier this year um about the
00:00:50.239 technology adoption life cycle and how
00:00:52.640 technology is typically adopted
00:00:54.039 throughout a a market all right so you
00:00:55.800 guys have seen it if you haven't already
00:00:57.000 watched that video I highly recommend
00:00:58.239 you check that out it's kind of like
00:00:59.320 mandatory stuff for making money in
00:01:01.600 emerging Tech spaces so I'll put a video
00:01:03.800 link up here or on the description or
00:01:05.438 somewhere um and I recommend you watch
00:01:07.320 that first cuz it's when I break down um
00:01:09.520 the Dynamics of the market and how
00:01:12.080 technology is adopted by businesses or
00:01:14.119 by any anyone really um in different
00:01:15.720 stages you have the innovators you have
00:01:17.640 the early adopters you have the early
00:01:18.960 majority the late majority and then the
00:01:20.680 laggards but
00:01:22.360 basically technology adopted in
00:01:24.439 different phases by different groups of
00:01:25.840 people who have different inclinations
00:01:28.720 towards the technology right maybe
00:01:30.079 they're an early adopter and they see
00:01:31.799 they like to take a bit of a gamble or
00:01:33.240 risk on new technology or they're in the
00:01:35.600 early majority which are people that
00:01:37.320 need to see a bit with proof and
00:01:38.840 evidence before they can make a jump and
00:01:40.399 take the investment um but all of this
00:01:42.560 is based around us trying to sell AI
00:01:44.280 systems and services and solutions to
00:01:46.000 businesses and you're going to get a
00:01:47.680 spread of business owners who fall into
00:01:49.280 different categories right and how this
00:01:51.520 relates to the big shift we're going to
00:01:52.880 see next year is that for the most part
00:01:55.960 we have been focused over the past two
00:01:58.119 years and so really talked about this
00:01:59.360 model and and it's gained so much
00:02:00.920 traction in the past two years it's been
00:02:03.119 primarily focused on the implementation
00:02:05.159 section and this is because we've been
00:02:07.560 primarily dealing with uh early adopters
00:02:09.840 and by implementation I mean
00:02:11.560 implementing AI into their businesses
00:02:13.280 like actually Building Systems for them
00:02:15.400 and saying this is going to make some
00:02:16.680 kind of meaningful difference in your
00:02:17.879 business so that's implementation and
00:02:20.000 that's what we've really been focused on
00:02:21.200 it's can you get these early adopters or
00:02:23.160 business owners who are interested in Ai
00:02:24.959 and basically profit off of their
00:02:27.480 interest and willingness to spend money
00:02:29.280 on this new technology that excites them
00:02:31.120 that they want to get ahead with and
00:02:32.720 that's what the AI automation agency
00:02:34.160 model up to this point is largely being
00:02:35.840 based around which is there's a bunch of
00:02:37.640 really adopters who want to spend some
00:02:38.959 money we can Market ourselves through
00:02:41.080 personal branding through YouTube
00:02:42.360 through if you're doing like cold
00:02:43.560 outbound as well basically get yourself
00:02:45.360 in front of these people or try to find
00:02:47.040 those who are interested in it and offer
00:02:49.680 your services and say hey look if
00:02:50.800 there's something that you would like to
00:02:51.720 build um we can do it for you or even
00:02:54.440 identify a more specific offer that you
00:02:56.319 sell um that you've really dialed in and
00:02:58.280 you found hey this is a great offer to
00:02:59.560 sell and you're reaching out to
00:03:00.879 businesses and trying to say hey I can
00:03:02.760 do this for you and then providing a bit
00:03:04.640 more proof so that's more so dealing
00:03:06.120 with the early majority and trying to
00:03:08.080 sell to people who aren't necessarily
00:03:10.120 implementation or or ready for AI
00:03:12.680 systems or aware enough about the
00:03:14.200 problem and or about the benefits they
00:03:15.879 provide the key is that the
00:03:17.040 implementation layer that we've been so
00:03:18.760 focused on is actually what we have
00:03:20.840 realized at morning side AI uh over the
00:03:22.959 past say 3 to 6 months as we've been
00:03:24.920 working with our our Consulting division
00:03:26.519 that we've set up here in New Zealand is
00:03:28.519 that the implementation step is actually
00:03:30.959 kind of way way down the pipeline and
00:03:33.879 it's really a late stage way of
00:03:35.799 capturing value in the AI space as an
00:03:37.560 agency and you've got a lot that happens
00:03:39.840 before that and while it has been good
00:03:41.840 to start off initially and just deal
00:03:43.439 with the implementation uh and selling
00:03:45.319 implementation for businesses who are
00:03:47.120 ready for it and and eager for it sure
00:03:48.879 that's been a great way for us to get
00:03:50.319 our agency off the ground and as for
00:03:51.760 many of you guys as well um we see that
00:03:54.079 there's a much bigger opportunity going
00:03:55.599 into 2025 and a slightly different model
00:03:58.400 and I mean if you go right back to when
00:04:00.159 I first started talking about the AI
00:04:02.079 automation agency model it was aimed at
00:04:05.040 small to mediumsized businesses and
00:04:06.519 helping them to implement and integrate
00:04:08.159 AI into the business and it was always
00:04:10.720 really leaning towards you are going to
00:04:12.400 be the in the same way that social media
00:04:14.480 marketing agencies were the people who
00:04:16.040 helped businesses to move online and
00:04:18.040 start uh not necessarily Move online not
00:04:20.199 like set up their website but I mean
00:04:21.680 they do that sometimes but move into
00:04:23.520 social media marketing and start start
00:04:25.280 being their guide to getting into the
00:04:27.720 digital marketing era and that's what
00:04:29.520 the AI automation agency model is
00:04:31.120 ultimately going to move towards uh in
00:04:33.880 the long run but next year is when I
00:04:35.320 really see that shift taking place and
00:04:37.360 that you're going to see us moving more
00:04:38.759 towards or the agencies who really
00:04:40.320 succeed moving more towards being the AI
00:04:43.280 transformation partner for businesses
00:04:45.600 and whether that's being general which
00:04:46.919 may be quite difficult or niching down
00:04:48.880 to saying hey I I'm the AI
00:04:50.440 transformation partner for and and I'll
00:04:52.320 explain exactly what that means on an
00:04:54.280 implementation and on a like operational
00:04:56.560 standpoint in a second I saying we are
00:04:58.800 we help planning businesses transition
00:05:00.919 into the AI it's basically the the offer
00:05:03.000 that you're you're helping them out with
00:05:04.520 right or that you're you're presenting
00:05:06.080 to them and so the way this would look
00:05:08.639 as we see that morning side AI we're
00:05:10.400 starting to identify these real key key
00:05:13.120 areas uh that your agency can can focus
00:05:15.680 on and can provide value to businesses
00:05:17.840 and this really allows you to tap into a
00:05:20.240 much larger chunk of that market of of
00:05:22.600 business owners right the technology
00:05:23.880 adoption life life cycle we've got these
00:05:26.000 big chunks of the business owner
00:05:27.520 population in in your given niche who
00:05:30.120 are not ready for AI implementation yet
00:05:32.199 but this strategy that I'm talking about
00:05:33.800 right now essentially allows you to tap
00:05:35.560 into pretty much the entire spectrum and
00:05:38.199 everyone in the market because you're
00:05:39.960 taking a different approach than going
00:05:41.199 straight from implementation right so
00:05:43.800 this strategy this AI transformation
00:05:46.160 partner kind of offer starts with basic
00:05:49.840 education right so that's taking
00:05:51.400 businesses we've found in our Consulting
00:05:53.319 business that we've started here that
00:05:55.440 you go to some of these companies and
00:05:56.880 they just know absolutely nothing and
00:05:59.639 even at this point they're still at the
00:06:01.360 starting blocks and this is in New
00:06:03.039 Zealand we are not on the most on the
00:06:05.400 front foot necessarily with AI here in
00:06:07.280 the states it might be a little bit more
00:06:09.919 common for businesses to be making moves
00:06:11.400 but I'd say on the most part if you go
00:06:12.960 and start knocking on doors around your
00:06:14.599 your city if you're living in the states
00:06:15.919 if you live anywhere and you start
00:06:17.360 knocking on doors of businesses and
00:06:18.680 asking them about what do you know about
00:06:20.319 Ai and uh what benefits does it present
00:06:23.280 what are the risks um have you thought
00:06:24.919 about implementing it you asking all
00:06:26.880 these basic questions and the business
00:06:28.039 owner just like M I have no clue what
00:06:29.800 you're talking about and I'm not really
00:06:32.080 that interested in it sure I'd like to
00:06:34.479 make more money and spend less um but I
00:06:37.000 don't know what this AI stuff is so step
00:06:39.199 one is that there's a huge opportunity
00:06:41.520 for just basic education and there's the
00:06:45.240 whole population and business owners
00:06:47.240 need to be brought up to speed in it
00:06:48.400 just like they did with what is a
00:06:49.919 website and why the hell should I put it
00:06:51.479 in why the would I spend money on
00:06:53.759 getting a getting a website set up right
00:06:56.000 this we have the same opportunity now
00:06:57.759 and yes we've been focused so much on
00:06:59.080 implementation
00:07:00.120 but you go back like two steps I'll
00:07:02.039 explain the in a second and the first
00:07:04.000 thing is just what is the technology
00:07:06.240 what what does it actually do uh what
00:07:08.960 are the risks with it and like what are
00:07:11.879 what what's the difficulties of me
00:07:13.440 getting to the point where I actually
00:07:14.360 get some value out of it so we see there
00:07:16.440 as being a big opportunity if you're
00:07:18.720 really looking to scale into 2025 and
00:07:20.599 Beyond so that you can tap into say your
00:07:22.639 entire Niche not just the plumbers who
00:07:24.680 are I'm using Plumbing as an example but
00:07:27.080 not just the plumbing businesses who are
00:07:28.840 watching my video or are kind of really
00:07:31.520 really techy and and they're ready for
00:07:33.319 implementation and they're aware of what
00:07:34.599 AI is which should be obviously a very
00:07:37.000 small portion of the the plumber
00:07:38.680 business own the population but by
00:07:40.199 positioning your business in a in a way
00:07:42.160 that says look we can actually do the
00:07:43.759 education section so we can start to
00:07:45.199 convert that 97% of people who are not
00:07:47.560 interested and start to move them down
00:07:49.520 the the pipeline towards being
00:07:51.080 implementation ready that is step one so
00:07:54.560 step one would be education okay can you
00:07:56.960 go they use Plumbing as an example again
00:07:58.879 but this is for any nich this is when
00:08:00.080 being niched down is probably going to
00:08:01.319 be the significant Advantage because
00:08:03.400 it's going to buy from industry to
00:08:04.599 Industry right we saying we help XYZ
00:08:07.159 types of businesses to transition into
00:08:09.000 the
00:08:09.680 aih there's this different wording for
00:08:11.840 that I mean that's probably not what we
00:08:13.080 would ultimately go for for the the
00:08:15.000 offer that we working on a morning side
00:08:16.280 AI but that's the the main concept of it
00:08:18.319 right so you've got Education First what
00:08:20.400 do a tech and then the next step after
00:08:22.360 that is once they've got that
00:08:23.240 foundational understanding it's like
00:08:25.520 okay now let's go into use case
00:08:27.960 identification and this is what we see
00:08:29.800 as the kind of Consulting portion and
00:08:31.840 where we've learned from our own
00:08:33.039 Consulting team that there's this really
00:08:34.679 key need of use case identification with
00:08:37.320 the businesses and a team that can go
00:08:38.799 through and do a really rapid and
00:08:40.080 efficient AI audit and that we see as
00:08:43.919 the second layer of of this this new
00:08:46.600 kind of AI transformation offer we've
00:08:48.200 educated them okay now we can actually
00:08:50.200 have a proper productive discussion
00:08:53.080 about what this stuff can do for your
00:08:55.240 business so you've understood the
00:08:56.800 foundations now the next layer on top of
00:08:58.680 that is what can it actually do for your
00:09:00.880 business let's run through some of the
00:09:02.200 systems you have right now let's
00:09:03.880 identify any of the low hanging fruit
00:09:05.680 let's do a breakdown of okay well this
00:09:07.240 is big opportunities the the uh the
00:09:10.880 difficulty value Matrix which I've
00:09:12.160 talked about on the channel here before
00:09:13.440 again I'll link a video to it in the
00:09:16.040 description or somewhere here a lot of
00:09:18.000 the stuff I've already talked about
00:09:19.040 before um but I know we often need to be
00:09:21.000 reminded uh more than we need to be How
00:09:24.399 does it go we often the what is that
00:09:26.720 saying we need to be reminded more than
00:09:29.480 we need to be
00:09:30.800 told oh
00:09:34.399 no we need to be reminded more than we
00:09:36.640 need to be taught so again I'm just
00:09:37.880 reminding you of the things that I've
00:09:39.160 talked about here before but basically
00:09:40.440 walking through use case identification
00:09:42.000 with them where do these things that
00:09:44.240 we've discovered and identifi within
00:09:45.760 your business and where do they fall on
00:09:47.040 the difficulty value Matrix like how are
00:09:49.399 there some low hanging fruits some some
00:09:51.079 quick wins that are not very difficult
00:09:53.560 to implement but are hugely valuable and
00:09:55.560 one of the longer term projects that we
00:09:57.040 can look at that are going to be high
00:09:58.360 value but also High difficulty and take
00:10:00.200 time and so being able to make a bit of
00:10:02.399 a road map or timeline on how they can
00:10:04.040 start to take those off then you are
00:10:06.160 ready for the implementation section and
00:10:08.240 then we get to what we've all kind of
00:10:09.440 been familiar with with this AI
00:10:10.760 automation agency which is actually
00:10:12.120 using our development teams to build the
00:10:14.040 systems for them and then go through the
00:10:15.880 the cycles of iteration to get them
00:10:17.320 performing well and then managing that
00:10:19.160 system moving forward so I guess
00:10:20.880 implementation would be one and then
00:10:22.519 you've even got another step after that
00:10:23.880 which is ongoing optimization and
00:10:25.720 maintenance
00:10:27.399 so so technically there's four parts of
00:10:29.920 that right the education what is the
00:10:32.279 stuff Consulting and use Cas
00:10:34.600 notification how can this actually help
00:10:36.320 my business how does it apply to my
00:10:37.920 business implementation okay let's
00:10:40.120 actually build this now and then the
00:10:41.480 ongoing maintenance so there's four
00:10:43.160 different ways that you can create value
00:10:44.680 and sell things to them right and that
00:10:46.440 can either be sold as a package where
00:10:48.399 it's like okay this is going to be
00:10:49.320 $155,000 for me to we do we help
00:10:52.000 plumbers to move from here to here we
00:10:53.839 have this complete offer and we're going
00:10:55.800 to walk you through step by step by step
00:10:57.440 or you can start to like kind of make
00:10:59.440 that more peace meal and you can say hey
00:11:01.279 we have this free education offer and
00:11:03.560 then you can advertise directly to
00:11:04.680 Plumbers you can go to you can go to
00:11:06.200 Plumbing conventions again Plumbing as
00:11:08.320 the example um and then you can say okay
00:11:11.720 well I'm going to do the education I'll
00:11:12.959 actually give the education away for
00:11:14.279 free and build some trust with these
00:11:16.200 plumbers and say I am the go-to guy for
00:11:18.519 AI and your plumbing business and then
00:11:20.480 you can sell them on the use case
00:11:21.639 dentification you say oh actually we've
00:11:22.920 got $2,000 package for um use case
00:11:25.600 notification you'll work with our
00:11:26.959 Consultants directly we'll run through a
00:11:28.639 whole process identify the best ways
00:11:30.200 that you can use AI within your business
00:11:31.680 and if you are smart about it you do
00:11:33.480 stay niched down CU you can just keep
00:11:35.320 doing it's basically how how different
00:11:37.519 can one Plumbing business be from the
00:11:39.120 other you actually aren't having to
00:11:40.399 reinvent the wheel each time with this
00:11:42.160 user case identification there may be
00:11:44.079 some differences but for the most part
00:11:46.320 it would be like booking systems or you
00:11:48.360 know like optimizing schedules and and
00:11:50.320 stuff like that
00:11:51.560 so the use case identification package
00:11:54.399 could become pretty lucrative as well
00:11:56.079 and then you have the team as well to
00:11:57.680 sell it and whether you are this is when
00:11:59.320 becomes actually really good for people
00:12:00.839 who are non-technical because if you get
00:12:03.000 to the point where I'm like you're
00:12:04.440 really good at selling you might be good
00:12:06.120 at getting on camera or writing and you
00:12:07.720 can really Market yourself or you've
00:12:09.760 always been very much on the sales or or
00:12:11.240 marketing side of a business or that's
00:12:13.480 just the way you lean kind of naturally
00:12:15.240 you can do your thing you can become hey
00:12:17.000 I'm going to be the educator and I'm
00:12:18.519 going to have this team of consultants
00:12:19.800 and then when it comes to implementation
00:12:21.440 I'm not going to have my own team of
00:12:22.600 devs I'm going to be passing off to Dev
00:12:24.639 Partners say you go to my free community
00:12:26.560 or if you're part of my accelerator you
00:12:27.760 can network with the the guys who are
00:12:29.240 doing numbers in there and you find
00:12:30.959 capable development Partners who don't
00:12:32.880 want to do the marketing who don't want
00:12:34.199 to do all the selling crap that they
00:12:35.959 don't there's never really part of their
00:12:38.440 MO and stuff that they want to do as a
00:12:40.000 developer and then you can just pass
00:12:41.880 them off and say hey look we'll take 20%
00:12:43.800 of any deals we send you and these are
00:12:46.440 going to be our implementation partners
00:12:48.399 and that way you get to flex this
00:12:50.160 business model to what you need and if
00:12:51.519 you're a development partner you can
00:12:52.959 find people who are doing the strategy
00:12:54.440 and doing the educating and you get to
00:12:56.279 just get the leads that you want and if
00:12:57.560 you think often if it's custom
00:13:00.040 development your margins may be I know
00:13:02.920 50 60% and so if you are a markety sales
00:13:06.760 person who's going to be doing that
00:13:07.920 education and priming them for that
00:13:09.760 implementation step the actual real
00:13:12.079 value creation and how you get hundred
00:13:14.320 of thousands of dollars in savings and
00:13:16.079 you're passing it off and getting 15 to
00:13:17.560 20% you like that's you're almost there
00:13:20.880 if a project runs runs long and you end
00:13:23.079 up going uh over over um the expected
00:13:26.800 timeline you could only end up profiting
00:13:28.760 20% % and you've had to have the whole
00:13:30.920 div team and do all of the management
00:13:32.240 yourself so it can actually be pretty
00:13:34.000 like if you're just getting 20% pure
00:13:35.399 profit for just passing it off it's not
00:13:37.360 actually that much worse you're making
00:13:38.440 like like half the profit that a full
00:13:40.800 Dev agency would be making but with 0%
00:13:43.320 of the headache that comes with running
00:13:44.560 the whole Dev so that's not to say I
00:13:46.320 highly recommend you should just go and
00:13:48.720 sell it and then pass it off that's just
00:13:50.519 a strategy that you can adopt
00:13:52.440 and my point here with this whole video
00:13:54.519 is that I think this is where this is
00:13:56.040 where we see it going this is where we
00:13:57.360 are moving our agency and I'm going to
00:13:58.720 upate you more on that next year but we
00:14:01.040 see this as really the uh the
00:14:02.800 opportunity to scale hard into different
00:14:05.399 Industries because once you have that
00:14:07.120 offer you've got I have education for
00:14:08.720 them I have a great team of Consultants
00:14:10.600 that I can or Consulting strategy at
00:14:12.440 least like a system where you can get
00:14:13.959 one of your team on and they go on and
00:14:15.480 they walk through this this this this
00:14:16.800 this great we've got that that's a you
00:14:18.560 can sell that as a package or you can
00:14:19.920 just have it as part of this whole
00:14:21.000 package as well but then you get you
00:14:23.360 unlock that technology adoption life
00:14:25.279 cycle you unlock a significant chunk of
00:14:27.399 the market when now you can Market to
00:14:29.720 any business owner because you have
00:14:31.040 something for every stage of the
00:14:32.360 Readiness like hey okay let's still a
00:14:34.360 quick question there do you know about
00:14:35.720 Ai and what things yeah yeah got a
00:14:37.320 pretty good idea okay great well do you
00:14:39.279 know where it can best help your
00:14:40.519 business I yeah that's really where
00:14:42.720 we're stuck we're not sure okay great
00:14:43.839 well we've got a Consulting package we
00:14:45.320 can get you straight onto that and then
00:14:46.800 after that we've got some great partners
00:14:47.959 that we can help you uh connect with or
00:14:49.880 we can actually build it for yourself
00:14:51.680 and then there's another opportunity
00:14:53.360 that comes off the back of that that we
00:14:54.519 are eyeing up particularly at
00:14:56.040 Morningside Ai and that's if you did
00:14:58.360 have a group of De Partners say you were
00:15:00.240 doing this make a package that say $5 or
00:15:02.399 $20,000 for this AI transformation
00:15:04.600 that's into end you've taken them from
00:15:06.480 basic education you've even got maybe a
00:15:09.000 layer of Staff education in there as
00:15:10.440 well where it's like upskilling them as
00:15:12.199 well Consulting implementation
00:15:13.959 maintenance teacher and then if you're
00:15:15.519 really smart you can hand off all of the
00:15:17.279 kind of lower ticket smaller stuff to
00:15:18.880 your Dev agencies that you identify with
00:15:20.600 them your partners and then if there's
00:15:22.639 one really interesting thing that you're
00:15:24.120 like wow I think we could build
00:15:25.519 something around that and actually start
00:15:26.600 to sell it to other businesses within
00:15:28.160 that niche then you say we're going to
00:15:29.680 put our Dev team on this one it might be
00:15:31.360 like a really complex sales system but
00:15:33.360 you know it's going to drive a ton of
00:15:34.480 value or we've had things that were
00:15:36.199 popped up recently in the Consulting we
00:15:37.680 do run to like a computer vision
00:15:39.519 Inventory management system and so well
00:15:41.279 if we built that we could actually then
00:15:43.720 start to sell that to other businesses
00:15:45.160 in that Niche and you start to build up
00:15:46.319 a bit of a portfolio of these software
00:15:49.160 Solutions AI software solutions that are
00:15:51.360 massively useful and you've got a great
00:15:52.920 case study to then go and sell it on to
00:15:54.680 other people so that's how you can start
00:15:56.000 to build a bit of a software portfolio
00:15:57.639 as well so
00:15:59.480 I I don't want to go much deeper on that
00:16:01.319 cuz I'll I'll take the window out of my
00:16:03.160 sales for next year and what we're doing
00:16:04.880 at Morningside but I thought I'd put you
00:16:07.120 guys onto a bit of game there as to
00:16:08.839 where I see the market moving and I
00:16:11.360 think this is something you should all
00:16:13.279 be considering if you you might have a
00:16:15.079 good thing going with the implementation
00:16:16.319 already and you got a good good amount
00:16:17.920 of momentum but looking further ahead
00:16:20.800 and if you really want to unlock a
00:16:22.240 bigger chunk of the market now that we
00:16:23.639 are getting a little bit more
00:16:24.680 competition there's more people trying
00:16:25.839 to come after this that's not to say
00:16:27.279 we're late I still think we are so so
00:16:29.120 bloody early to this when you when you
00:16:30.959 again when you do the knock on the door
00:16:32.199 test and there's like no businesses
00:16:33.800 using it um it shows that we are still
00:16:35.920 so early uh but this is something you
00:16:38.360 should look to be doing hey how can I
00:16:39.920 start to unlock and tap into more of
00:16:42.360 this untapped market and it's not just
00:16:44.240 those early adopter who are really ready
00:16:46.440 for this technology already but I want
00:16:48.319 to start accessing that bigger part the
00:16:50.279 early majority and even the late
00:16:51.560 majority by being able to give them a
00:16:53.759 much more beginner for anything and tell
00:16:55.040 you like hey AI is really going to spre
00:16:57.480 shap the industry I know can seem quite
00:16:59.519 scary and daunting but if you give me
00:17:01.480 I've got this free program or this free
00:17:03.000 little course that's going to walk you
00:17:04.199 through we've got a paid course whatever
00:17:05.919 it is that's going to take them through
00:17:07.280 to the stage where they're ready for use
00:17:08.640 case identification and you got to start
00:17:10.439 thinking about it in these different
00:17:11.640 layers of of value that you can provide
00:17:14.039 so that's my little message for 2015 um
00:17:18.199 I'm super excited for this and I can't
00:17:19.839 wait to see some of you take this kind
00:17:22.079 of offer and just absolutely crush it
00:17:24.119 and and dominate niches U either within
00:17:26.720 your within your country or
00:17:27.919 internationally as well I'm just so
00:17:29.480 excited because there's so much
00:17:30.640 potential left like we have just just
00:17:32.559 got started when you're seeing that
00:17:33.720 we're now developing the model to this
00:17:36.320 point and the all these companies are
00:17:38.559 still starting at the they're still at
00:17:40.440 the starting blocks so um I hope you
00:17:43.360 guys are excited for 2025 there's so
00:17:45.440 much opportunity and so much to be
00:17:48.240 gained um here monetarily but also just
00:17:52.360 in like self-actualization and uh like
00:17:55.000 building something building a business
00:17:56.320 in the space and feeling like you've
00:17:57.640 achieved something feeling like you're
00:17:58.960 proud of yourself and I think that is as
00:18:01.840 much of a part of Entrepreneurship as
00:18:03.200 just the money like once you make the
00:18:04.400 money you need to find some other kind
00:18:06.080 of purpose so yeah I hope you guys have
00:18:10.480 had a excellent 2025 uh 2024 sorry and
00:18:15.400 uh I'm really rooting for all of you to
00:18:16.720 have an even better year in 2025 so
